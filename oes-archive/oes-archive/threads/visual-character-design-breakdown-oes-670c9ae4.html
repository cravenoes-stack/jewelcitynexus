                <div class="message-content">Create visual for:

Visual Breakdown:

1. Cape

	â€¢	Start with the long, hooded white cape from the image you provided. This is the central piece that will stand out visually, so place it as the main garment on the character.
	â€¢	Ensure the cape flows down past the characterâ€™s knees for a dramatic effect, with the hood either up or down, depending on the visual style you prefer.

2. Fireball Wand

	â€¢	Place a wand in one of the characterâ€™s hands, emitting small fake flames or magical fire energy. You can make the flames orange or red, swirling around the tip of the wand for a magical effect.
	â€¢	The wand itself should be dark in color (black or deep brown), contrasting against the white of the cape.

3. Tunic and Pants

	â€¢	Under the cape, visualize a long tunic or robe that extends to mid-thigh, in deep red or burnt orange. The sleeves of the tunic should peek out from under the long white sleeves of the cape.
	â€¢	The pants can be slightly baggy, either in dark brown or black. These should look comfortable, allowing for movement, and possibly tucked into boots.

4. Accessories

	â€¢	Add a large pendant or medallion around the characterâ€™s neck. Use a green stone similar to the one in the provided image to create a mystical vibe.
	â€¢	Fingerless gloves should be drawn on the hands to give the character a rugged, spellcaster look.
	â€¢	You could also include small pouches or bags hanging from the belt area, hinting at magical components like herbs or potions.

5. Boots

	â€¢	Draw in leather boots that reach just below the knees, with straps or buckles to match the adventurer look. Keep the color dark brown or black to balance the overall theme.

6. Head and Face

	â€¢	If the hood is up, only part of the face would be visible, adding to the mystery. If down, draw long hair or shoulder-length hair, slightly tousled, giving off an air of someone who spends time in both mystical realms and rugged terrain.
	â€¢	Dark eyeliner around the eyes gives a mystical and intense appearance. You could add some faint glowing highlights on the face (such as a light golden glow) to represent the fiery magic within.

How to Create the Visual:

Option 1: Use Canva (or other design tools)

	1.	Start with a Base Character Silhouette: Choose a basic humanoid character template from Canva or similar platforms.
	2.	Add the White Hooded Cape: Upload or choose an image of a white hooded cape. Place this over the characterâ€™s shoulders, ensuring itâ€™s long and flowing.
	3.	Tunic and Accessories: Layer a dark red or burnt orange tunic beneath the cape. Then, add accessory images like wands, amulets, or belts from Canvaâ€™s stock images or other sources.
	4.	Add Fire Effects: Use element effects in Canva (like flame or magic effects) to create the fire coming from the wand.
	5.	Enhance with Shadows and Glow: Use Canvaâ€™s glow effects or shadow elements to make the character stand out.</div>
