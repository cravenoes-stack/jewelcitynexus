                <div class="message-content">It appears that there are significant issues with this file's formatting, which are preventing it from being read using the usual methods. Given these constraints, a couple of options could be considered:

1. **Manual Inspection:** You could inspect the file directly using Excel or another spreadsheet program to identify any specific formatting issues, such as problematic cells, corrupted data, or non-standard formatting.

2. **Simplified File Version:** If possible, save the file in a simpler format (e.g., removing any complex formatting, styles, or macros) and try uploading it again.

3. **Specific Sheet Targeting:** If you know which specific sheet you need data from, you could specify it, and I can try to target that directly with minimal processing.

- Alternatively, I can provide you with a summary of the data loaded.

At this point, the best course of action would be:

1. **Manual Examination:** Open the file in Excel or another spreadsheet software to manually review and possibly correct any issues.
2. **Simplified Save:** Save the file in a simpler format (e.g., CSV, or a new Excel file without complex formatting or styles) and re-upload.
3. **Specific Data Extraction:** If there are specific pieces of data or sheets you are interested in, you might consider extracting them manually for now.
