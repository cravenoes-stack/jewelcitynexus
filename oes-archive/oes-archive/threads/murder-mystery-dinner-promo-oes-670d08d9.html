	‚Ä¢	Text Overlay: ‚ÄúSolve the Mystery‚Ä¶ Before It‚Äôs Too Late‚Äù

Text Style: Bold, attention-grabbing text for the call-to-action. The final overlay should have a button-style graphic for online bookings.

Additional Tips:

	‚Ä¢	Music: Use subtle, suspenseful background music throughout the video, with slight build-ups during transitions between scenes. Make sure the music complements the suspense/mystery theme.
	‚Ä¢	Transitions: Use smooth, cinematic transitions between scenes. Opt for fades or slow zooms to maintain the elegant, immersive vibe.
	‚Ä¢	Pacing: Keep the video fast-paced but allow viewers to absorb the mystery. Make each scene impactful but not overwhelming, keeping the focus on the intrigue and exclusivity of the event.</div>

Dates: Friday, October 25th, and Saturday, October 26th

Scene 1: Opening Teaser (6-7 seconds)

Visual:
The video opens with a sweeping aerial shot of the dimly lit dining room at Le Bistro, fully transformed to reflect the vibrancy and mystery of Dia de los Muertos. The walls are adorned with colorful sugar skulls, marigold flowers, and candles illuminating the space. Altars with offerings (ofrendas) stand as centerpieces on each table, and the soft glow from the chandelier reflects off the intricately painted decorations.

The camera pans over the tables, each set with dark satin tablecloths, accented by the brilliant colors of the holiday‚Äîdeep reds, oranges, and golds. The decorations create a juxtaposition between life and death, reminding guests of the celebration of those who have passed. Flickering candles cast long shadows across the walls, which are adorned with symbolic D√≠a de los Muertos paintings and decor, giving the dining room a mystical, sacred atmosphere.

Text Overlay:
‚ÄúStep into a World Where Spirits Linger and Secrets Rise from the Grave‚Ä¶‚Äù

Action:
A slow zoom reveals one of the ornate altars set in the middle of the dining room, filled with glowing candles, offerings of bread, fruits, and painted skulls. The tension builds as the sound of distant, echoing footsteps and whispered prayers can be heard faintly. The camera lingers on the altar‚Äôs intricate details, before focusing on the flickering candles and shifting to the shadows cast against the walls.

Text Style:
The text, in an elegant script font with subtle glowing accents, emerges softly, as if carried on a wisp of smoke from one of the altar‚Äôs candles. The text flickers into view and then fades away slowly.

Scene 2: The Spirits Arrive (8-9 seconds)

Visual:
Cut to a more intimate shot as the main characters of The Spirit‚Äôs Revenge arrive in the dining room. The camera zooms in on Diego Perez (The Historian), dressed in elegant, traditional Day of the Dead attire. His eyes, solemn and wise, observe the guests around him. His face is painted like a skull, but his expression is one of deep thought, as if he‚Äôs already piecing together the events of the night.

Behind him, Enrique ‚ÄúRico‚Äù Castillo (The Bartender) stands at the bar, his face partially hidden by shadows. His dark attire and the secrets he holds give him a mysterious aura. The camera catches a glimpse of him quickly stashing away something beneath the bar before turning his back to the guests.

Cut to Maria Flores (The Spirit Medium), who moves gracefully between tables, her flowing robes trailing behind her like the wind. Her eyes are closed as if she is in constant communication with the spirits surrounding the room. Her hands hold talismans and other spiritual objects, which she gently places on the tables, each one representing a significant part of the ritual.

Text Overlay:
‚ÄúA Night of Spirits, Secrets, and Ancient Curses‚Ä¶‚Äù

Action:
The camera moves between the guests and the characters. Diego pauses, looking directly into the camera, whispering words of caution to the audience, his voice low and full of foreboding. Meanwhile, Rico is seen pouring a drink, but his eyes remain watchful, scanning the room as if hiding something important. Maria, with her ethereal presence, touches the shoulder of a guest, whispering something inaudible that leaves the guest looking puzzled and nervous.

Text Style:
The text glitches slightly, almost as if disturbed by a spiritual force. The letters glow faintly before fading away, mirroring the suspense in the air.

Scene 3: The Ritual Begins (10-12 seconds)

Visual:
The scene transitions to the heart of the evening, where guests are now fully engrossed in the mystery. The camera focuses on a small group of guests seated at a candle-lit table. In front of them sits Raul Ortiz (The Lost Soul), his face a mix of concern and confusion as he shares his cryptic dreams about the spirits. His hand trembles as he points to a note, half-burnt and covered in ash, given to him earlier by Elysia Morales (The Shapeshifter).

Cut to Luz Santos (The Ancestor‚Äôs Descendant), who stands in front of an altar, her face calm and serene. She delicately places an offering onto the altar‚Äîan ancient family heirloom, which she believes holds the key to breaking the curse. The camera captures the intensity of her actions, though no one suspects that she harbors the darkest secret of all.

Text Overlay:
‚ÄúThe Ritual Has Begun‚Ä¶ Will You Discover the Truth Before the Night Ends?‚Äù

Action:
The camera zooms in on Raul‚Äôs face as he recounts his mysterious dreams, the flickering light casting eerie shadows across his face. The scene quickly shifts to Luz, who moves gracefully through the room, her every action seemingly innocent, though the audience knows she‚Äôs concealing a sinister motive. Cut to a shot of Elysia, whose face shifts before the audience‚Äôs eyes‚Äîher features subtly transforming as her shape-shifting powers come into play. The scene builds tension as the clock ticks softly in the background, reminding everyone that time is running out.

Text Style:
The text appears as if written in smoke, twisting and swirling before fully forming on screen. It glows with a faint, spectral light before dissipating like a fading spirit.

Scene 4: The Feast of Spirits (6-8 seconds)

Visual:
The camera cuts to a beautifully plated dish, presented in the low-lit dining room. The dish‚Äîa tender piece of grilled meat garnished with flowers and herbs representing the Day of the Dead‚Äîsits elegantly on a plate adorned with traditional motifs of skulls and marigolds. The presentation is stunning, combining the vibrant colors of the holiday with a rich, luxurious culinary experience.

Behind the dish, a cloud of fog (created by dry ice) rolls out from the altar, filling the air with a mystical aura. The guests at the table watch with amazement as a server, dressed in traditional D√≠a de los Muertos attire, places the dish in front of them, bowing ceremoniously before moving on to the next table.

Visual:
The scene shifts to a wide shot of the dining room, showing guests deeply engaged in conversation and theorizing about the night‚Äôs events. Laughter mixes with gasps of realization as one group of guests points out a hidden clue. At another table, a couple whispers intensely, their brows furrowed as they try to piece together the intricate puzzle.

The camera cuts to Isabella Rivera (The Party Host) standing beside a guest, smiling confidently as she explains the importance of the event. Her expression is light and jovial, but there‚Äôs a subtle tension in her demeanor. Across the room, Rico can be seen wiping down the bar, his eyes darting toward Isabella, his hand shaking slightly as if hiding something from her.

Each character‚Äôs actions, from Isabella‚Äôs confident demeanor to Rico‚Äôs secretive movements, build the intrigue even more.

Text Style:
The text glows brightly before flickering out, as if fading away like the spirits of those being honored.

Visual:
The camera fades to black, and then opens with a wide, sweeping shot of the entire dining room, now bathed in soft candlelight. The ofrendas glow softly, casting warm light on the guests as they continue to investigate the mystery.

"Create an eerie, moonlit street scene featuring an outdoor caf√© with dimly lit bistro-style seating. The caf√© has a shadowy glow, with flickering candles inside and twisted, overgrown plants surrounding the outdoor tables. The storefront sign reads 'Le Bistro,' illuminated faintly under a weathered, old awning. The street is deserted, with mist rolling in, creating an ominous, haunted atmosphere. The vibe is mysterious and unsettling, perfect for a night of dark secrets."

This version keeps the original charm of the caf√© but adds a mysterious and eerie tone to fit the coven murder mystery theme!</div>

---

"Create a dimly lit street scene of the same caf√©, 'Le Bistro,' but from a lower, closer angle. The bistro tables remain in shadow, with candles flickering more intensely as fog begins to creep along the street. The sign above is partially obscured by mist, while the warm glow inside the caf√© contrasts with the darkening, eerie street outside. The atmosphere feels more tense and foreboding, as if something is about to unfold in the shadows."

---

**1. First Image (Skull-Faced Figure with Two People at a Table):**

Prompt:  
"Depict a scene where Serafina Eldridge, the High Witch, stands at the entrance of Le Bistro, dressed in intricate, dark robes. She welcomes two guests with an air of mystery. A faint, ghostly glow surrounds her as the candles flicker. The guests are intrigued yet wary, exchanging tense glances as Serafina prepares them for the secrets to unfold inside."

---

**2. Second Image (Table Scene with Skeleton Figures):**

Prompt:  
"Create a tense dinner scene where the coven members, including Sable Blackthorn and Lilith Ravenspell, are seated at a dimly lit table in Le Bistro. Across from them sits Balthazar Thorn, the Warlock, whose presence brings a heavy sense of foreboding. Flickering candlelight casts shadows on their faces as they exchange cryptic conversations about the coming ritual. A figure, cloaked in shadows, stands in the background, watching over them."

---

**3. Third Image (Another Dinner Scene with Suspenseful Lighting):**

Prompt:  
"Show a close-up of a heated discussion at the dinner table between Draven Hawke, the Spirit Summoner, and Ronan Blackwood, the Exiled. Both appear suspicious of each other as their dark pasts are revealed. The rest of the coven watches intently, with Lucien Evernight, the Seer, quietly observing from the shadows, as if anticipating an upcoming betrayal. The atmosphere is thick with tension, magic lingering in the air."

---

**4. Fourth Image (Gourmet Dish with Candlelight):**

Prompt:  
"Depict a beautifully plated gourmet dish in the center of Le Bistro‚Äôs candlelit table. Surrounding the dish are enchanted herbs and ingredients gathered by Isolde Frostveil, the Potion Mistress. The candles flicker gently, and there‚Äôs an ethereal glow to the meal, suggesting it plays a role in the upcoming coven ritual. The dining room‚Äôs ornate chandeliers and mysterious ambiance hint at the supernatural forces at play."

"Depict a shadowy figure standing in the dimly lit hallway of Le Bistro, facing a mysterious door illuminated by an eerie glow.

The figure, cloaked in dark robes, hesitates at the threshold, sensing the powerful magic behind the door."
