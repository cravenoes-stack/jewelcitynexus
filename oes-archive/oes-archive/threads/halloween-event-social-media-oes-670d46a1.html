                </div>
                <div class="message-content">Step 1: Prepare Your Assets

You’ll need:

	•	Ad copy (already written)
	•	Creative image (the one generated above)
	•	Target audience details (you’ve identified Halloween enthusiasts, likely adults aged 18-40 with an interest in immersive experiences and mysteries)
	•	Call-to-action (CTA) (encouraging booking or RSVPs with phrases like “Book Now” or “Secure Your Spot”)

Step 2: Create Organic Social Media Posts

For Facebook &amp; Instagram:

	1.	Image Post:
	•	Upload the creative image to your post.
	•	Use the following caption:
Caption:
“🔮 Ready for a night of mystery, magic, and mayhem? Join The Hexed Circle this Halloween and unravel the secrets of a coven murder!
Costumes encouraged. Spots are limited, so don’t wait—book your place now! 🕯️✨”
Hashtags:
#HalloweenEvent #MurderMystery #TheHexedCircle #WitchyVibes #Halloween2024 #MysteryNight #MagicAndMayhem
	2.	Story Posts:
	•	Use the creative image in Instagram Stories.
	•	Add a swipe-up link (if available) or prompt users to “Check the Link in Bio” for bookings.
	•	Include engaging text like:
“Can you solve the mystery? 🧙‍♀️🔮 Join the coven this Halloween. Spots are limited!”

For Twitter/X:

	1.	Tweet:
	•	Post a shorter version of the copy with the image:
Tweet:
“Unravel the mystery this Halloween with The Hexed Circle! 🧙‍♀️ A night of magic, secrets, and a coven murder. Limited spots—secure yours now! 🎃🔮 #MurderMystery #HalloweenEvent #TheHexedCircle”
	2.	Promoted Tweet (optional):
	•	Boost the post with a targeted audience (focus on Halloween enthusiasts, escape room fans, and immersive event-goers).

Step 3: Set Up Paid Ads

For Facebook &amp; Instagram Ads:

	1.	Ad Objective: Choose “Event Responses” or “Website Visits” (to drive traffic to your booking page).
	2.	Target Audience:
	•	Location: Target local area (city or region where the event takes place).
	•	Age: 18-40.
	•	Interests: Halloween, immersive experiences, murder mystery, escape rooms, cosplay, fantasy books and films.
	3.	Creative Setup:
	•	Upload the creative image.
	•	Use the following ad copy:
Primary Text:
“This Halloween, join the coven and uncover the mysteries of The Hexed Circle. Costumes, magic, and a murder await—can you solve it before time runs out? 🧙‍♀️✨ Limited spots available—book your spot today!”
Headline:
“Join The Hexed Circle: Halloween Murder Mystery”
Call to Action (CTA):
“Book Now”
	4.	Ad Budget:
Set your budget based on the number of bookings you want to achieve, and run the ads at least 2-3 weeks before the event to build awareness.

For Google Ads:

	1.	Create a New Campaign:
	•	Choose the campaign type: “Search” or “Display” (for visual ads).
	2.	Target Keywords:
Use keywords like:
	•	“Halloween murder mystery”
	•	“immersive Halloween event”
	•	“coven mystery game”
	•	“Halloween activities near me”
	3.	Ad Copy:
	•	Use the following headlines and descriptions in your Google Ads campaign:
Headlines:
	•	“Solve The Hexed Circle Mystery”
	•	“Join a Coven Halloween Experience”
	•	“Uncover Secrets &amp; Intrigue”
Descriptions:
	•	“Step into a world of magic and mystery. Become part of the coven and solve the murder before time runs out!”
	•	“A Halloween event filled with suspense, clues, and magic. Reserve your spot now for The Hexed Circle!”
	4.	Landing Page:
Ensure your landing page (event booking page) is optimized with the same visuals and messaging as your ads, along with a prominent Book Now button.

Step 4: Track and Optimize

	1.	Monitor Engagement:
	•	Use social media insights (on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X) to track engagement, clicks, and RSVPs.
	•	Adjust your budget based on which platforms are performing best.
	2.	Retargeting:
	•	Use Facebook Pixel and Google Analytics to set up retargeting ads for users who visited your event page but didn’t book, reminding them to secure their spot.
	3.	Adjust Copy if Needed:
If a particular ad isn’t performing well, test different headlines or CTAs like “Hurry, Limited Spots Available!” or “Don’t Miss the Most Immersive Halloween Experience!”

By following these steps, you’ll create a cohesive and effective campaign to drive awareness and bookings for The Hexed Circle: Coven Murder Mystery event across social media and paid platforms</div>

                <div class="message-content">Thank you for sharing the image. It shows the campaign objective options for creating an ad set, which includes:

1. **Awareness**
2. **Traffic**
3. **Engagement**
4. **Leads**
5. **App promotion**
6. **Sales** (Recommended)

To set up an ad for your event, you would want to focus on objectives that align with driving bookings or ticket sales. In this case, you might consider selecting either:

- **Traffic** if you want to drive more people to your event landing page.
- **Sales** if your primary goal is direct conversions (like ticket purchases).

If your goal is more about awareness and brand building, then **Awareness** could work, but for this type of event-focused campaign, **Sales** or **Traffic** is likely the best choice.

Would you like further advice on setting up the campaign or choosing between these options?</div>

                <div class="message-content">From the images you shared, I can see that you've set up your campaign with the **Sales** objective, which is recommended for driving ticket purchases. The other settings visible include options like **Advantage+ catalog ads**, **Advantage campaign budget**, and **A/B testing**, all of which can be useful for optimizing your ad performance.

Here are a few tips based on what you've shared:

1. **Advantage+ catalog ads**: You can use this feature to reach people more likely to engage with your product. However, if your event doesn't involve a broad range of products, you can keep this feature off unless you have a catalog prepared for your event or related offerings.

2. **Advantage campaign budget**: Turning this on allows Facebook to distribute your budget across different ad sets based on performance. It can be useful if you have multiple ad sets and want Facebook to focus on the highest-performing ones, but you can control spending manually if you'd prefer to keep a close eye on each ad set.

3. **A/B Testing**: This is a valuable tool to test different versions of your ad (like varying images, copy, or targeting) to see what works best. I recommend enabling A/B testing, especially if you're unsure which creative or targeting will drive the most conversions.

4. **Reporting**: You can define audience segments like **Engaged audience** and **Existing customers**. If you have these lists ready, use them to create tailored ad campaigns to reach specific groups with more personalized messages.

                <div class="message-content">It seems I'm unable to access external websites directly at the moment. However, you can check the purchasing page on your own and ensure that it:

1. **Loads quickly** – Make sure the page is optimized for speed, as slow-loading pages can lead to drop-offs.
2. **Has clear call-to-action (CTA)** – Your “Book Now” or similar CTA should be prominent, ideally above the fold, and repeated throughout the page.
3. **Is mobile-friendly** – Ensure that the page is responsive and looks good on mobile devices, as many users may be accessing it through social media ads on their phones.
4. **Matches your ad copy** – Keep the visuals and messaging consistent with what you’ve used in the ads to reduce confusion and increase trust.
5. **Features event details** – Important details like event time, location, and any special instructions (costumes, character selection) should be easily accessible.
