2. **The Mystery Element**:
   - Emphasize that **one of the event's characters will be ‚Äúkilled‚Äù**, and it‚Äôs up to the guests to **solve the mystery**.
   - Incorporate the role of the **Investigators**, who must gather clues and question other guests, which builds tension and intrigue for the video.

3. **Character Highlights**: 
   - Briefly introduce a few **intriguing characters**, such as **Felipe del Muerto**, the Graveyard Keeper, or **Raul Rivera**, the Skeptic, to add depth to the event. Mention their unique personalities and secrets, which might tie into the mystery.
   
4. **Exclusive Experience**:
   - Mention that this is a **sold-out, exclusive event**, creating urgency around getting the last available tickets.
   - Include **costume suggestions** for attendees, as it adds a participatory element that people may find exciting.
