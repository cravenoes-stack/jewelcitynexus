                </div>
                <div class="message-content">To ensure you are fully prepared for a busy night at The Cellar Door, here are several extra steps you can take to streamline operations, minimize delays, and ensure everything runs smoothly:

### **1. Overprepare Garnishes and Fresh Ingredients**
- **Fresh Juice:** Double your usual daily prep amounts of lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange juice. Make sure these are all freshly squeezed and ready for immediate use.
- **Mint &amp; Basil:** Prepare extra sprigs of fresh mint and basil, storing them in cold water to maintain freshness throughout the night.
- **Dehydrated Fruits:** Make sure your supply of dehydrated orange, lime, and pineapple wheels is well-stocked.
- **Pineapple Slices &amp; Leaves:** Pre-slice additional pineapple and set aside plenty of pineapple leaves for garnishes.
- **Herbs &amp; Flowers:** Double your rosemary and edible flower inventory. These items can run out quickly on a busy night.
  
### **2. Pre-Batch Ingredients**
- **Pre-batch Popular Cocktails:** If there are any cocktails on your menu that are crowd favorites, consider pre-batching their non-alcoholic ingredients to speed up service. For example:
  - Pre-batch the syrup, juice, and other mixers for cocktails like the **Peach Smash** or **Hibiscus Mule** (leaving out alcohol to maintain quality).
- **Syrups &amp; Mixers:** Prepare extra batches of any house-made syrups (like **Simple Syrup**, **Hibiscus Syrup**, **Honey Water**, etc.) to avoid running out mid-shift.
  
### **3. Ensure a Well-Organized Bar Setup**
- **Glassware:** Make sure all glassware is fully stocked and chilled before service. Overprepare by chilling more than the usual amount of martini, rocks, coupe, and tiki glasses.
- **Ice Supply:** Make sure you have an abundance of both regular ice and large cubes (for Old Fashioneds and similar drinks). Have backup ice supplies in easily accessible locations.
- **Pre-Rimmed Glasses:** Pre-rim some glasses (e.g., for margaritas with chili salt rims) in advance and store them in the cooler.
- **Cloche Setup for Smoky Drinks:** Prepare smoking elements like wood chips or rosemary sprigs in advance for any smoked cocktails.

### **4. Staff Briefing and Task Delegation**
- **Delegate Roles:** Assign specific bartenders to particular stations (e.g., one bartender making shaken cocktails, another handling stirred drinks or specialty cocktails) to streamline service.
- **Task a Barback:** Have a dedicated barback for keeping the bar stocked with glassware, ice, and garnishes throughout the night, so bartenders can focus on service.
  
### **5. Keep Backup Supplies Accessible**
- **Backup Garnishes:** Place extra garnishes in backup containers in easily accessible areas so they can be quickly swapped out.
- **Backup Ice &amp; Glassware:** Keep extra ice and glassware ready nearby to refill without disrupting service.
  
### **6. Organize an Efficient POS System**
- **Preprogram Popular Drinks:** Program frequently ordered drinks into the POS system with quick-order buttons to minimize time spent placing orders.
  
### **7. Ensure Communication Between Front-of-House and Bar**
- **Clear Communication:** Brief servers on cocktail menu highlights and ensure they’re prepared to suggest drinks that are quick to make or pre-batched to manage traffic at the bar.
  
### **8. Extra Clean Glassware, Tools, and Surfaces**
- **Glassware Polishing:** Ensure all glassware is polished before the night begins to avoid delays.
- **Bar Tools:** Keep extra clean bar tools (jiggers, shakers, strainers) ready to use if the bar gets crowded and tools can’t be washed immediately.
  
### **9. Maintain a Clean, Organized Work Area**
- **Ongoing Cleanup:** Assign someone (bartender or barback) to periodically clean and organize the bar area, ensuring dirty glassware is quickly removed, trash is emptied, and surfaces remain clean.
  
### **10. Prepare for High-Volume Orders**
- **Bar Stations:** Set up multiple stations with essentials (spoons, muddlers, strainers, jiggers) so that bartenders don’t have to wait to use shared equipment.
- **Cocktail Recipe Cards:** Keep a quick reference of cocktail recipes behind the bar to help bartenders move quickly when making complex drinks.

By overpreparing in these areas, you’ll ensure a smooth and efficient service during your busy night. Planning ahead, being proactive, and organizing the bar setup and staff will minimize delays and create a seamless guest experience.</div>

1. **Option 1:** Garnish with a **lime wheel** and a **mint sprig** (instead of hibiscus flowers).
2. **Option 2:** Dehydrated lime wheel with a **mint sprig**.
3. **Option 3:** **Lime wedge** and **large ice sphere** (with no embedded flowers).

1. **Option 1:** Garnish with a **pineapple wedge** and a **maraschino cherry** on the rim (a classic and simple garnish).
2. **Option 2:** Use a **dehydrated orange slice** with a **mint sprig** for a tropical touch.
