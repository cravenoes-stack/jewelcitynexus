   - Highlight **traditional Mexican music** playing throughout the evening, especially during the dinner and the investigation phase.

2. **The Mystery Element**:
   - Emphasize that **one of the event's characters will be “killed”**, and it’s up to the guests to **solve the mystery**.
   - Incorporate the role of the **Investigators**, who must gather clues and question other guests, which builds tension and intrigue for the video.

3. **Character Highlights**: 
   - Briefly introduce a few **intriguing characters**, such as **Felipe del Muerto**, the Graveyard Keeper, or **Raul Rivera**, the Skeptic, to add depth to the event. Mention their unique personalities and secrets, which might tie into the mystery.
   
4. **Exclusive Experience**:
   - Mention that this is a **sold-out, exclusive event**, creating urgency around getting the last available tickets.
   - Include **costume suggestions** for attendees, as it adds a participatory element that people may find exciting.

Here’s how you could adapt the script:

---

🎃 "Enter a world of mystery and tradition at Le Bistro's Dia de los Muertos Murder Mystery Dinner, October 25th and 26th."  
🕯️ "Solve the murder amidst vibrant ofrendas, cempasúchil, and the spirits of the dead."

🎭 "Limited tickets available for this sold-out, spine-chilling experience."

📅 "Join us for an unforgettable night of mystery, music, and Mexican-inspired cuisine."
