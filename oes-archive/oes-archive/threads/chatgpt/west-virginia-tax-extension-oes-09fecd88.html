                <div class="message-content">Certainly! To file for an extension of your business tax return for the state of West Virginia for the 2023 tax year, youâ€™ll typically need to follow these steps:

### 1. **Determine the Type of Business Return:**
   - Confirm whether you need to file an extension for a Corporation, S Corporation, or other business entity. Since your businesses are corporations, you'll likely need to file a Corporate Net Income Tax extension.

### 2. **Use the Correct Form:**
   - For West Virginia, you'll need to file **Form WV/CNF-120EXT**, which is the Application for Extension of Time to File West Virginia Corporation Net Income/Business Franchise Tax Return.

### 3. **Calculate Estimated Taxes Due:**
   - If you expect to owe taxes, you should estimate your tax liability and pay at least 90% of it to avoid penalties. The payment can be made using the extension form or electronically via the West Virginia State Tax Departmentâ€™s online services.

### 4. **Submit the Form:**
   - **Mail**: You can mail the completed Form WV/CNF-120EXT to the West Virginia State Tax Department. Make sure itâ€™s postmarked by the original due date of the return, which is typically the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of your tax year (April 15th for calendar-year filers).
   - **Online**: Alternatively, you can file for an extension electronically through the West Virginia State Tax Department's website or via an authorized e-file provider.

### 5. **Recordkeeping:**
   - Keep a copy of the submitted form and any payment confirmation for your records.

### 6. **Extended Deadline:**
   - If the extension is approved, the extended deadline is generally six months from the original due date.

### Key Information You May Need:
   - Business Name: Navi Inc / Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc
   - FEIN: 85-0828765 / 45-4443122
   - Address: 905 3rd AVE, Huntington, WV 25701
   - Estimated tax payment amount (if applicable).

                </div>
                <div class="message-content">To file for an extension of your S Corporation tax return (Form 1120-S) for the 2023 tax year, you'll need to use **IRS Form 7004**, which is the application for an automatic extension of time to file certain business income tax, information, and other returns. Since you're an S Corporation and expect no taxes due, the process is relatively straightforward.

Hereâ€™s how to complete Form 7004:

### **1. Business Information**
   - **Name**: Navi Inc / Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc
   - **Employer Identification Number (EIN)**: 85-0828765 / 45-4443122
   - **Address**: 905 3rd AVE, Huntington, WV 25701

### **2. Part I: Automatic 6-Month Extension**
   - **Box 1**: Check this box to indicate that you are requesting an automatic 6-month extension.
   - **Box 2**: Enter the applicable code for your business. For S Corporations, enter **25**.

### **3. Part II: Tentative Total Tax**
   - **Box 3**: Enter the tentative total tax you expect to owe (If you do not expect to owe any taxes, enter **0**).
   - **Box 4**: Enter the total payments and credits. If none, enter **0**.
   - **Box 5**: Subtract Box 4 from Box 3 (This is your balance due, if any). If you do not owe any taxes, enter **0**.

### **4. Part III: Signature**
   - Sign and date the form. As President of Navi Inc and Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc, you would sign here.

### **Submitting Form 7004:**
   - **Electronic Filing**: The IRS recommends e-filing Form 7004, which is faster and provides immediate confirmation of receipt. You can e-file using authorized e-file providers.
   - **Mail**: If you prefer to mail the form, the mailing address depends on your location. For West Virginia (with no payment), the mailing address is:

     ```
     Department of the Treasury
     Internal Revenue Service Center
     Kansas City, MO 64999-0019
     ```
