                <div class="message-content">Given that you want to apply bar pricing, typically, bar pricing includes a higher markup due to factors like ambiance, service, and overall experience. The standard industry markup for bars often ranges between 200% to 400% over the cost price, depending on the venue, clientele, and competition.

For this scenario, I'll calculate the bar pricing using a 300% markup, which is common in many establishments, and then present those prices to you. Let's proceed with this calculation.</div>

                <div class="message-content">When pricing for 1.5-ounce shots, the approach involves calculating the price per shot based on the cost of the entire bottle and the number of shots that can be obtained from it. Here's how we can calculate this:

1. **Determine the number of 1.5-ounce shots per bottle**:
   - A standard bottle of liquor is 750 mL, which is approximately 25.36 ounces.
   - Dividing this by 1.5 ounces per shot gives approximately 16.91 shots per bottle.

2. **Calculate the price per shot**:
   - We'll divide the total cost of the bottle by the number of shots it yields.
   - Apply the bar markup to get the final selling price per shot.

I will proceed with this calculation using the cost information provided in the inventory data and apply the 300% markup for bar pricing.</div>

2. **Menu Group**: The category or group the item belongs to (e.g., Spirits, Cellar Bourbon).
3. **Sales Price**: The current sales price of the item.
4. **Yield**: The serving size or quantity.

### Next Steps:
1. **Update the pricing** for the matched items using the provided sales price.
2. **Apply a 300% markup** to determine the bar pricing.
3. **Round the prices** to the nearest dollar or fifty cents.
4. **Identify any further unmatched items** and calculate the average price and changes.

                <div class="message-content">The bar price for "Bulleit" (or in this case, "Bulleit Rye") was calculated using the following method:

1. **Sales Price**: The base sales price listed in the recipe book is **$4.00**.

2. **Bar Price Calculation**: A 300% markup is applied to the sales price to calculate the bar price. This means the formula used was:
   \[
   \text{Bar Price} = \text{Sales Price} \times 4
   \]
   For "Bulleit Rye," this calculation would be:
   \[
   4.00 \times 4 = 16.00
   \]

3. **Rounded Bar Price**: The calculated bar price is then rounded to the nearest dollar or fifty cents using the rounding function. In this case, the bar price was $16.00, which is already rounded, so no further adjustment was needed.

Thus, the final **Rounded Bar Price** for "Bulleit Rye" was set to **$16.00**.

                <div class="message-content">It seems that the extraction process for some sheets is still encountering issues, particularly when trying to convert values from cell E11. The error suggests that the value in cell E11 is either missing or not properly formatted as expected.

To address this, I will review the specific entries that caused issues, check if they contain any data in cell E11, and ensure proper handling of those values.

                <div class="message-content">The extraction process encountered issues with cell E11 for all the items listed above, which suggests that either the data is missing, formatted incorrectly, or perhaps the sheets have a different structure.

To resolve this:

1. I will examine the structure of a few of these sheets to understand why the extraction from cell E11 failed.
2. I will correct the extraction method to ensure it works even if the data is slightly different or missing.

Let's start by inspecting a few of these sheets manually.</div>

Given this pattern, I will:

1. Adjust the extraction process to look for the "Spirit" row and pull the value from the "Cost" column directly, rather than relying on cell E11.
2. Apply this correction to all the problematic sheets.

### Next Steps:
1. **Inspect the sheet structure manually** to identify where the cost might actually be located.
2. **Adjust the extraction logic** to pull the correct value based on the actual sheet structure.

                <div class="message-content">It appears that many items still encountered issues either due to the sheet not being found or the inability to extract and convert the values in the expected cells.

### Summary of Issues:
1. **Missing Sheets**: The named sheet for some items was not found, likely due to differences in naming conventions.
2. **Conversion Issues**: For sheets that were found, the expected cost value could not be converted due to it being `NaN` or otherwise improperly formatted.

### Next Steps:
- **Manually Verify a Few More Key Items**: I'll manually check for slight variations in names and inspect their sheets to see if we can recover the correct data.
- **Focus on Recovering Usable Data**: I'll prioritize items where the cost can be found and calculate the pricing for those.

This suggests that either the cost data is located elsewhere in the "Bulleit Rye" sheet, or the sheet names for "Elijah Craig" and "Bombay Sapphire" might be different.

### Next Steps:
1. **Further Inspect the "Bulleit Rye" Sheet**: I'll look deeper into the "Bulleit Rye" sheet to see if the cost is located elsewhere.

                <div class="message-content">The extraction results show:

- **Jack Daniels Single Barrel**: The sheet named "Jack Daniels Single Barrel Bar" was not found.
- **Jim Beam Single Barrel**: The sheet was found, but the value in the expected cell was `NaN`.

This suggests that either the sheets are named differently, or the data is formatted in a way that isn't aligning with the expected extraction method.

### Next Steps:
Given the challenges with finding or extracting data from these sheets, I suggest:

1. **Documenting the successful extractions** and calculated prices so far.
2. **Continuing to manually inspect items one by one** to see if we can extract further data, but noting that some items might require alternative approaches or be documented as unavailable.

Would you like to proceed with another specific item, or focus on finalizing the results we have so far?</div>
