3. Ensure all taps are closed, spirits locked, and POS is shut down correctly.

---

- **Suggest Premium Liquors:** When guests order a cocktail, suggest an upgrade to a higher-quality spirit.

---

- **Steps to Handle Complaints:**
  1. **Listen:** Let the guest explain the issue fully.

## **1. Introduction to Bartending**

### The Role of a Bartender:
As a bartender, you are more than just a drink maker. You are a host, entertainer, salesperson, and ambassador of our establishment. Your ability to craft high-quality drinks, build rapport with guests, and maintain a well-organized and efficient bar is essential to the success of our venue.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Consistency**: Every drink should be made to the same high standard, every time.
- **Speed**: Balance speed with quality, especially during high-volume periods.
- **Service**: Deliver excellent customer service and create a welcoming atmosphere.
  
### Suggested Visual: A graphic showing the bartender at the center of customer satisfaction, connecting consistency, speed, and service.

## **2. Bar Tools &amp; Equipment**

### Essential Bar Tools:
- **Shaker Set**: Boston shaker (two-piece) or Cobbler shaker (three-piece). **Usage**: Shaking cocktails with fruit juice or dairy.
- **Bar Spoon**: For stirring drinks, typically spirit-forward cocktails like Old Fashioneds and Martinis.
- **Jigger**: Precision is key—always measure your pours using a 1 oz/2 oz or 1/2 oz/1 oz jigger. No free pouring unless authorized.
- **Muddler**: Used to mash fruits, herbs, or sugar in cocktails like a Mojito.
- **Hawthorne &amp; Julep Strainer**: Use the Hawthorne for cocktails shaken with ice, and the Julep for stirred drinks.
- **Fine Strainer**: Perfect for ensuring no small ice chips or fruit bits make it into drinks like a Daiquiri.

### Additional Equipment:
- **Pour Spouts**: For consistent and controlled pouring of spirits.
- **Wine Key &amp; Bottle Opener**: Always within reach for serving wine or bottled beers.

### Suggested Visual: A labeled infographic displaying each bar tool with a brief description of its use.

## **3. Spirits &amp; Ingredients Overview**

### Spirits Breakdown:
- **Vodka**: A neutral spirit. Example cocktail: **Espresso Martini** (Recipe: Vodka, coffee liqueur, fresh espresso).
- **Whiskey**: Whiskey comes in many varieties (Bourbon, Scotch, Rye). Example cocktail: **Whiskey Sour** (Recipe: Bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, egg white).
- **Gin**: Juniper-forward flavor. Example cocktail: **Negroni** (Recipe: Gin, sweet vermouth, Campari).
- **Rum**: Light or dark rum; common in tropical drinks. Example cocktail: **Mojito** (Recipe: White rum, mint, lime, soda).
- **Tequila**: Agave-based. Example cocktail: **Paloma** (Recipe: Tequila, grapefruit soda, lime juice).

### Ingredients:
- **Bitters**: Small but powerful, bitters (e.g., Angostura, Peychaud's) add depth to cocktails.
- **Syrups**: Simple syrup is essential, but explore flavor infusions like cinnamon, ginger, or rosemary syrup.
  
### Suggested Visual: A detailed spirits chart that categorizes different types of spirits and their typical uses in cocktails.

## **4. Measuring &amp; Pouring Techniques**

### Precision Pouring:
Always use a jigger unless explicitly allowed to free-pour. Accurate pouring ensures consistency and cost control. **Examples**:
- A **single shot** is 1.5 oz, typically used in drinks like the Vodka Soda.
- A **double shot** is 3 oz, common in heavier cocktails like a Long Island Iced Tea.

### Free Pouring Technique:
If authorized, practice the four-count method (1 count = 0.5 oz). Start slow, then increase speed with confidence.

### Pouring Beer:
Tilt the glass at a 45-degree angle and pour slowly down the side to minimize foam. For nitro beers, pour directly into the center.

### Suggested Visual: A visual guide on the "four-count method" for free pouring with visual aids for counting speed.

- **Herbs**: Fresh herbs like mint (Mojitos) or basil (Gin Smash) elevate presentation.

### Advanced Garnishing:

### Handling Multiple Orders:
1. Prioritize drink orders based on the complexity of the cocktails.
2. Serve regulars or waiting guests in between mixing drinks to maintain flow.

---

## **10. Alcohol Responsibility &amp; Compliance**

### ID Verification:
Check the ID of anyone who looks under 40. Be familiar with valid forms of identification and what to look for on fake IDs.

### Suggested Visual: Example of a valid ID with visual cues to spot a fake ID (e.g., holograms, embossing).

Focus on upselling premium liquors, suggesting house cocktails, or promoting seasonal drinks. Always have knowledge of the current specials.

### Examples:
