                <div class="message-content">Here are some recommendations to strengthen your request for a complete penalty waiver:

1. **Express Accountability and Reasoning**: 
   - Acknowledge the oversight that led to the late payment clearly. If the delay was due to specific, understandable reasons (e.g., an unexpected business disruption, system error, or personal emergency), state them briefly and factually.
   - Example: "Due to an unforeseen disruption in our accounting system, we were unable to process the payment on time. We have since rectified the issue to prevent any future occurrences."

2. **Highlight Your Compliance History**:
   - Emphasize any history of timely payments or compliance with the state's requirements in the past. Demonstrating that this incident is an anomaly can help build your case.
   - Example: "Our business has consistently complied with all state tax obligations for over [number] years without incident, making this delay an isolated event."

3. **Emphasize the Financial Impact**:
   - If the penalty and interest would significantly affect your business, you might want to underscore this point. 
   - Example: "The current economic environment has already put considerable strain on our operations, and the additional penalty would exacerbate these challenges."

4. **Offer a Solution or Assurance**:
   - Include steps you've taken to ensure future compliance, which shows responsibility and commitment to resolving the issue.
   - Example: "We have implemented a new internal review process to ensure all payments are timely, preventing similar issues in the future."

5. **Professional and Respectful Tone**:
   - Ensure the letter maintains a polite and professional tone throughout, which is key in persuasive communication.

6. **Request Specific Action**:
   - Clearly state that you are requesting a full waiver of both the penalty and interest.
   - Example: "We respectfully request a complete waiver of the penalty and interest accrued due to this oversight."

                <div class="message-content">I'll guide you through how to incorporate each of the suggestions into your letter.

### 1. **Express Accountability and Reasoning**
   - **Current Statement:** If your letter includes any explanation of the late payment, ensure it clearly identifies the cause.
   - **Revised Example:** 
     "Due to an unforeseen disruption in our accounting system, we were unable to process the payment on time. This was an isolated incident, and we have since rectified the issue to prevent any future occurrences."

### 2. **Highlight Your Compliance History**
   - **Current Statement:** If your letter doesn't currently emphasize your history of compliance, consider adding a sentence or two.
   - **Revised Example:**
     "Our business has consistently complied with all state tax obligations over the past [number] years without incident, making this delay an anomaly."

### 3. **Emphasize the Financial Impact**
   - **Current Statement:** If not addressed, you might want to add a paragraph about how the penalty affects your business.
   - **Revised Example:**
     "The current economic environment has put considerable strain on our operations, and the additional penalty would exacerbate these challenges, potentially impacting our ability to sustain our business."

### 4. **Offer a Solution or Assurance**
   - **Current Statement:** If you've already discussed future compliance, ensure it is explicit and solution-focused.
   - **Revised Example:**
     "We have implemented a new internal review process to ensure all payments are made on time, preventing similar issues in the future."

### 5. **Maintain a Professional and Respectful Tone**
   - **Current Statement:** Review the entire letter to ensure the tone remains courteous and professional. Avoid any language that might come across as confrontational or overly emotional.

### 6. **Request Specific Action**
   - **Current Statement:** Your letter should explicitly ask for a full waiver.
   - **Revised Example:**
     "Given the circumstances, we respectfully request a complete waiver of the penalty and interest accrued due to this oversight."

### **Revised Section Example:**

Here's how a revised section of your letter might look with these suggestions incorporated:

---

**Dear [Recipient],**

Due to an unforeseen disruption in our accounting system, we were unable to process the payment on time. This was an isolated incident, and we have since rectified the issue to prevent any future occurrences.

The current economic environment has also put considerable strain on our operations, and the additional penalty would exacerbate these challenges, potentially impacting our ability to sustain our business.

**Subject: Request for Waiver of Penalty and Interest**

Dear [Recipient's Name or “To Whom It May Concern”],

I am writing to formally request a waiver of the penalty and interest charges that have accrued due to the late payment of our state sales tax for the period ending [specific date]. We recognize the importance of timely payments and have always strived to meet our obligations punctually. However, due to an unforeseen disruption in our accounting system, we were unable to process the payment on time.

We have taken this situation very seriously and have already implemented corrective measures to prevent such an incident from occurring in the future. Specifically, we have enhanced our internal review processes and added additional checks to ensure all tax payments are submitted timely.

Our business has a strong track record of compliance with West Virginia tax regulations. Over the past [number] years, we have consistently fulfilled our tax obligations without any previous incidents. This recent delay was an anomaly, and we deeply regret any inconvenience it may have caused.

The current economic environment has placed considerable strain on our operations, and the additional burden of the penalty and interest would exacerbate these challenges, potentially impacting our ability to sustain our business. 

Given our history of compliance and the unique circumstances surrounding this incident, we respectfully request a complete waiver of the penalty and interest. We are committed to ensuring that this situation does not repeat itself and appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,

**[Your Name]**

Encouraged by this grant, we were approached by two prominent business leaders in downtown Huntington, who offered us favorable lease terms to open new businesses in their properties. We signed two 10-year leases: one for a modern convenience store and another for a new southern-inspired restaurant. We hired key staff, including a general manager and an executive chef, each with a $50,000 annual salary.

As young business owners (aged 29 at the time), this was a significant blow, and we were unprepared for the financial impact it would cause.

This resulted in severe cash flow issues, and by December 2022, we were forced to negotiate buyout terms for the leases, closing the convenience store and halting renovations on the restaurant.

Unfortunately, due to integration issues between our capital provider and point of sale system, nearly 17% of daily sales were deducted, exacerbating our cash flow problems starting in June 2023. This issue persisted until February 2024, when the cash advance was finally paid off. During this period, the strain on our finances impacted employee morale, led to high staff turnover, increased labor costs, and ultimately affected our sales.</div>

**Subject: Request for Waiver of Penalty and Interest**

Dear [Recipient's Name or “To Whom It May Concern”],

I am writing to formally request a waiver of the penalty and interest charges that have accrued due to the late payment of our state sales tax for the period ending [specific date]. The delay in payment was the result of several unprecedented challenges our business faced, which I would like to outline below.

On May 28th, 2021, we were awarded a Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) grant in the amount of $333,779.28. Encouraged by this grant, we entered into two 10-year leases to open new businesses in downtown Huntington. However, on June 21st, 2021, we were unexpectedly informed by the SBA that our RRF award was canceled due to ongoing lawsuits, a development that severely impacted our financial planning. As young business owners at the time, we were unprepared for the financial strain this sudden cancellation would cause.

This setback, combined with our obligations under the new leases, led to significant cash flow issues. By December 2022, we had to negotiate buyout terms for these leases, resulting in the closure of one business and the halting of another. In our efforts to manage the cash flow, we secured a capital advance that was repaid through a percentage of our daily sales. However, due to integration issues with our point of sale system, a higher percentage than anticipated was deducted from our daily revenue, further exacerbating our financial difficulties until the advance was fully repaid in February 2024.

These compounding financial challenges have significantly impacted our ability to meet all our financial obligations on time. Despite these hardships, we have taken substantial steps to stabilize our business and prevent future occurrences of such issues. We have fully paid off our cash advance and have implemented stronger financial controls to ensure timely tax payments going forward.

Given our long history of compliance with West Virginia's tax requirements and the extraordinary circumstances that led to this delay, we respectfully request a complete waiver of the penalty and interest accrued. We believe this consideration would greatly assist us in recovering from these setbacks and allow us to continue contributing positively to the state’s economy.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration of our request. We look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,

**[Your Name]**

**Subject: Request for Waiver of Penalties and Interest on Past Due Sales Tax Payments for Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc (FEIN: 45-4443122)**

Dear Compliance Division,

I am writing to formally request a waiver of the penalty and interest charges that have accrued due to the late payment of our state sales tax for the period ending [specific date]. The delay in payment was the result of several unprecedented challenges our business faced, which I would like to outline below.

On May 28th, 2021, we were awarded a Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) grant in the amount of $333,779.28. Encouraged by this grant, we entered into two 10-year leases to open new businesses in downtown Huntington. However, on June 21st, 2021, we were unexpectedly informed by the SBA that our RRF award was canceled due to ongoing lawsuits, a development that severely impacted our financial planning. As young business owners at the time, we were unprepared for the financial strain this sudden cancellation would cause.

This setback, combined with our obligations under the new leases, led to significant cash flow issues. By December 2022, we had to negotiate buyout terms for these leases, resulting in the closure of one business and the halting of another. In our efforts to manage the cash flow, we secured a capital advance that was repaid through a percentage of our daily sales. However, due to integration issues with our point of sale system, a higher percentage than anticipated was deducted from our daily revenue, further exacerbating our financial difficulties until the advance was fully repaid in February 2024.

These compounding financial challenges have significantly impacted our ability to meet all our financial obligations on time. Despite these hardships, we have taken substantial steps to stabilize our business and prevent future occurrences of such issues. We have fully paid off our cash advance and have implemented stronger financial controls to ensure timely tax payments going forward.

Given our long history of compliance with West Virginia's tax requirements and the extraordinary circumstances that led to this delay, we respectfully request a complete waiver of the penalty and interest accrued. We believe this consideration would greatly assist us in recovering from these setbacks and allow us to continue contributing positively to the state’s economy.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration of our request. We look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,

**Christopher Craven**  
**President**  
**Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc**

                <div class="message-content">The letter is already strong and includes all the necessary details, but here are a few additional suggestions that could further enhance your request:

### 1. **Include Specific Financial Impact Details**:
   - If you can quantify how the penalties and interest have impacted your business (e.g., in terms of percentage of revenue, specific cash flow issues, or reduced operating capacity), this might add weight to your request.
   - **Example**: “The penalties and interest, totaling $X, represent a significant portion of our monthly operating budget, directly impacting our ability to maintain necessary staffing levels and meet other essential business obligations.”

### 2. **Attach Supporting Documentation**:
   - Mention that you are including supporting documentation with your request, such as:
     - The original RRF award and cancellation notice.
     - Lease agreements and termination settlements.
     - Financial statements showing the impact on your cash flow.
     - Correspondence with the SBA or financial institutions regarding your situation.
   - **Example**: “Attached are copies of the RRF award and cancellation notice, lease agreements, and financial statements demonstrating the financial impact these challenges have had on our business.”

### 3. **Express Willingness to Discuss Further**:
   - Offering to discuss the situation further or provide additional information can demonstrate your openness and cooperation.
   - **Example**: “We are more than willing to provide any additional information or discuss our situation further to assist in your review of this request.”

### 4. **Acknowledgment of State Support**:
   - Expressing gratitude for any past support or understanding from the state could foster goodwill.
   - **Example**: “We greatly appreciate the support that the West Virginia State Tax Department has provided to businesses like ours, and we hope that you will consider our request favorably given the circumstances.”

### 5. **Consider a Payment Plan Option (if applicable)**:
   - If a full waiver isn't possible, you might suggest a payment plan for the penalties and interest to demonstrate your commitment to resolving the issue.
   - **Example**: “If a full waiver is not feasible, we are prepared to discuss a reasonable payment plan to address the outstanding balance in a manner that allows our business to recover and thrive.”
