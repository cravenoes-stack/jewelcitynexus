                <div class="message-content">Create a visual based on the following:

“1. Overall Layout and Dimensions

The dining room is a rectangular space measuring 56.2 feet in length and 22.5 feet in width, with 13-foot high ceilings that provide an airy and open atmosphere. Guests enter through a 4-foot deep recessed inset, stepping into a warm and welcoming space.

2. Host Stand and Entrance Area

As guests enter through the front door, the host stand is directly to the left. This stand measures approximately 4 feet tall and 3 feet wide, made of light-colored wood, complementing other cabinetry in the dining room. The host stand serves as the primary reception area for greeting guests, organizing menus, and managing reservations.

Directly in front of the host stand is a small waiting area with two high-top round tables, each seating two guests. These tables, positioned near the bay window sections on either side of the door, offer a waiting area for guests.

3. Chandelier and Ceiling

The chandelier is located centrally over the host stand area, just to the left when guests enter through the front door. It is a crystal chandelier, ornate and elegant, casting a luxurious glow across the entry area and creating a focal point as guests walk in.

	•	Small Chandeliers in Bay Windows: Two smaller chandeliers hang in the bay windows to the left and right of the entrance, framing the area with soft lighting that contributes to the intimate ambiance near the waiting tables.

The ceiling features decorative tin tiles, which add a vintage charm to the restaurant. Exposed ductwork runs along the ceiling, blending modern industrial elements with the vintage décor.

4. Table Layout and Seating Arrangement

The seating in the restaurant is well organized, providing a mix of table shapes and sizes to accommodate different group sizes. The chairs themselves vary, with some featuring upholstered backs for added comfort.

	•	Left-Hand Wall (Booth Side):
	•	Along the left wall is a 34-foot long booth, with a 4-foot high backrest. The booth runs almost the entire length of the dining room, offering comfortable seating for smaller parties.
	•	Along this booth are four square tables, each measuring 3 feet by 3 feet, each seating two guests. These tables can also accommodate three if necessary, with the flexibility provided by the booth seating.
	•	Right-Hand Wall (Window Side):
	•	On the windowed right side of the room, there are four round tables, each with a 4-foot diameter. Each of these round tables seats four guests comfortably. The natural light from the windows gives this section a bright and open feel during the day.
	•	Center of the Room:
	•	Down the center of the dining room, there are eight square tables, each measuring 4 feet by 4 feet, and seating four guests per table. The tables are spaced about 4-5 feet apart, allowing guests to move freely between them.

5. Bar Area

The bar is located in the rear-left corner of the dining room and is L-shaped with a slight angle. The bar is 20 feet long, with the shorter section facing toward the center of the dining room. The bar seats 8 guests with padded stools along its polished wooden countertop.

	•	Behind the Bar:
	•	There is open shelving on the wall behind the bar, where liquor bottles and glassware are displayed. The shelves are softly lit with accent lighting, giving the bar area a warm, inviting glow.
	•	Below the bar counter are storage cabinets and drawers, where additional bar supplies and glassware are kept.
	•	Wine Cabinet Near the Bar:
	•	Adjacent to the bar is a tall wine cabinet, standing at around 7 feet high. The cabinet has wire mesh doors, providing a rustic yet elegant look while displaying the wine selection. This cabinet is used to store and showcase the restaurant’s wine selection, positioned conveniently near the bar for ease of access.

6. Server Stands

	•	New Server Stand (Entrance):
	•	A new server stand is positioned near the front entrance, just to the left of the host stand. This 4-foot high and 3-foot wide stand is made of light-colored wood and is used to organize cutlery, menus, and server tools.
	•	Server Stand Near the Bar:
	•	A second server stand is located near the bar, positioned for easy access by the bar and floor staff. This stand is similarly designed with a 4-foot height and matches the aesthetic of the surrounding cabinetry.

7. Cabinetry Along the Walls

Throughout the dining room, several storage cabinets and wine cabinets provide functionality and visual interest. These cabinets are primarily made of light-colored wood and feature both wire mesh doors and solid wood doors, depending on their use.

	•	Wine Storage: Some of the cabinets house wine bottles, positioned closer to the bar area for easy access.
	•	Storage Cabinets: Others are used for cutlery, napkins, and service items, designed to keep the dining room organized while blending with the restaurant’s elegant décor.

8. Support Columns

The dining room contains two vertical support columns, each 1 foot in diameter, placed along the left-hand side near the booth seating. These columns are positioned approximately 15 feet apart, helping to visually divide the room without obstructing movement.

9. Variety of Chairs

There are multiple styles of chairs throughout the dining room, offering both comfort and variety:

	•	Upholstered Chairs: Some chairs have padded, upholstered backs, which are used in the booth seating area and central dining tables for added comfort.
	•	Traditional Wooden Chairs: Other tables, particularly those along the windows, feature solid wooden chairs, offering a more traditional feel.

Floating Witches’ Hats Placement

Fishing Line Setup

The witches’ hats will be suspended from the ceiling using clear fishing line, strung across the room from wall to wall. The fishing lines will run the full 22.5-foot width of the dining room and be attached where the walls meet the ceiling. There will be 9 lines running across the dining room, evenly spaced from the front entrance area to the bar.

Witches’ Hat Distribution

The witches’ hats will be attached to the fishing lines using four pre-cut string lengths: 1.5 feet, 2.5 feet, 3 feet, and 4 feet. The goal is to create a dynamic, floating effect, with hats suspended at different heights.

	•	Line 1 (Near Entrance): 7 hats, with varying string lengths from 1.5 feet to 4 feet, will float above the high-top tables in the entryway.
	•	Line 2 (Booth Area): 6 hats, hung with a mix of string lengths, floating above the booth seating on the left-hand side. These hats will be hung slightly higher to avoid obstructing the flow of guests and servers.
	•	Line 3 (Center Tables): 8 hats, spaced widely, with string lengths between 1.5 feet and 4 feet. These hats will float lower, creating a playful canopy effect over the central tables.
	•	Line 4 (Window Side): 5 hats, hung slightly higher to maintain the flow of light from the windows. These hats will be attached with shorter strings to maintain visual balance.
	•	Line 5 (Central Area): 8 hats, floating above the central tables with varying string lengths to create depth and dimension.
	•	Line 6 (Booth Area): 5 hats, spaced evenly, floating lower to create a cozy, intimate feel for diners seated at the booth.
	•	Lines 7 to 9 (Toward Bar): Each line will feature 7 to 8 hats, suspended at varied heights. These hats will float above the bar and nearby tables, ensuring the entire room feels connected through the floating hat design.

Final Visual Effect

The witches’ hats will float organically throughout the dining room, creating a magical, immersive experience without detracting from the restaurant’s upscale ambiance. By varying the heights and string lengths, the visual effect will appear dynamic, making the hats feel as if they are hovering effortlessly above the guests, adding a touch of whimsical elegance to the room.”</div>
