                <div class="message-content">I will clean up the image and suggest replacements for the random text on the left side.

Based on what I can see in the logo, you want to preserve the design while making the text more cohesive. Here's what I'd suggest for the text:

1. **Upper Text** (currently showing random letters):
   - Suggestion: "ESTABLISHED 2020" or "ESTABLISHED 2012" (depending on the founding year of The Cellar Door)

2. **Lower Text** (currently showing random letters):
   - Suggestion: "FINE DRINKS &amp; SMALL PLATES" or "SIGNATURE COCKTAILS &amp; TAPAS"

These changes would give the logo a professional and consistent look while also emphasizing the upscale nature of your establishment. Once I clean up the image, I will integrate these suggestions visually.

Let me work on that.</div>

I'll go ahead and work on a different approach to achieve the results you're after.

For now, let me attempt one final fix using the resources available, and then I can suggest other ways to achieve the specific outcome you're looking for. I'll give this one more try.</div>

The second image is one of the images you have given me that i like, but there is an additional “l” after the “r” in ”cellar” and the “r” in “door” is represented as a “d”. Will you please not give me a stupid link to click on and will you please review the image you are giving me before you post it in your response. Don’t post a photo until it is truly correct and i know you can analyze a photo for characters within it. you must have a way to review a photo before you present it to me.</div>
