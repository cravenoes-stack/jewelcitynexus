\[
\text{Cost} = \text{Proposed New Price} \times \text{Target Cost Percentage (28\%)}
\]

This means the cost represents the portion of the proposed new price that corresponds to 28% of that price, which aligns with your target cost percentage for managing profit margins.

If you're asking for the actual cost of the liquor bottles or pours from suppliers (i.e., the price you pay to stock these items), that information would typically come from your inventory or purchasing records, which would be different from the cost percentage approach used here. If you have specific cost data from suppliers, we can integrate that for more accurate pricing analysis.</div>
