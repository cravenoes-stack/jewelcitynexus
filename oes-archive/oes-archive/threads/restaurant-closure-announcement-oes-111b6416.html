### **Day 2: Behind-the-Scenes Sneak Peeks**
**Le Bistro:**
- **Social Media Stories/Posts**: Share behind-the-scenes photos or videos of the ongoing improvements. This could include staff training sessions, the ambiance changes, or sneak peeks of any new décor.

### **Day 3: Countdown and Exclusive Offers**
**Le Bistro:**
- **Countdown Post**: Start a countdown on social media with “3 days to go!” Include hints about what’s new or improved.
- **Exclusive Offer**: Announce an exclusive offer for the reopening day, such as “Free dessert with any entrée” for the first 50 customers.
- **Email Reminder**: Send another email as a reminder about the upcoming reopening and the special offers available during the first week.

### **Reopening Day: Celebration**
**Le Bistro &amp; The Cellar Door:**
- **Live Updates**: Post live updates throughout the day with photos of the first guests, behind-the-scenes looks at the kitchen or bar, and shots of people enjoying the new space and offers.
- **Social Media Stories**: Use Instagram and Facebook Stories to share real-time excitement, including customer reactions to the new changes.
- **Thank You Post**: End the day with a thank-you post to all who came and a reminder of ongoing specials for the week.
