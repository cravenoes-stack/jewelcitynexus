<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>Subject: Response to Termination Notice – Lease Provisions and Procedural Requirements</strong>

Dear [Landlord’s Name],

While I acknowledge that there have been instances of late rent payments, Section 24(f) of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any written notices of default regarding these late payments, and without such notices, the claim of ‘repeated default’ cannot be procedurally supported. As a result, this basis for termination does not comply with the requirements set forth in our lease agreement.

Moreover, while Section 23 includes a non-waiver clause, which theoretically preserves DBG Properties’ right to enforce payment deadlines despite accepting late payments, the consistent acceptance of late rent for 40 out of the last 45 months without prior formal objection reasonably suggests a different understanding was in practice. While I understand that the lease provides for the landlord’s right to enforce terms at any time, it is equally important to acknowledge that the absence of any written notice of default severely undermines the validity of invoking the non-waiver clause at this stage.

Additionally, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations, which we have regularly communicated since we began leasing the space in September 2020. Rent has consistently been accepted under these circumstances until now, without formal objection or concern. This abrupt shift in approach raises questions as to whether other factors may be influencing this sudden termination action.

I remain committed to finding a resolution and look forward to further discussing how we can move forward in a way that supports both parties.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

<h3>Key Enhancements:</h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Clarity on Backup Defense:</strong> The revised version subtly acknowledges the non-waiver clause without relying on it as the primary defense. It emphasizes that the real issue is the failure to issue written notices.
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Tone of the Non-Waiver Clause:</strong> By not overemphasizing the landlord’s potential defense, it leaves room for interpretation while underscoring the significance of their consistent acceptance of late payments.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Subtle Reference to Bad Faith:</strong> The line about “other factors” influencing the termination is retained but softened to “raises questions,” implying a possible bad faith argument without directly accusing them.</ol></li>

                            <div class="message-text">By "underscoring the significance of their consistent acceptance of late payments," I mean emphasizing how the landlord's behavior over time—specifically, accepting late rent payments for 40 out of the past 45 months—has created a reasonable expectation that they would not strictly enforce the lease’s deadlines. This long-standing pattern of acceptance suggests a possible understanding or tolerance between both parties, even though the lease has a non-waiver clause that technically protects the landlord’s right to enforce the deadlines later on.

Essentially, you're pointing out that the landlord’s history of accepting late payments without objection could lead to an assumption that strict enforcement of deadlines wasn't a priority, thus weakening their argument for suddenly terminating the lease based on those late payments. The point is that, while the lease may technically allow the landlord to enforce the terms, their past behavior indicates they haven’t been doing so consistently, which could be seen as undermining their current stance.</div>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Option 1: Emphasizing Procedural Compliance and Fair Dealing</strong></h3>

Dear [Landlord’s Name],

I understand that rent has been late on some occasions, but Section 24(f) of our lease explicitly requires that DBG Properties issue written notice for each default, as detailed in Sections 24(a)(i) and 36, in order to establish grounds for termination based on late payments. To date, no such written notices have been provided for any of the instances in question, making it procedurally impossible to support a claim of ‘repeated default’ under the lease. Without these notices, this ground for termination is invalid.

While Section 23 of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, the consistent acceptance of late rent payments over the past 40 months without objection reasonably implies a pattern of behavior. This may have led to an understanding that strict enforcement of payment deadlines was not a priority. While I recognize the non-waiver clause, it’s important to point out that the landlord’s failure to provide the required written notices is the more relevant issue here, as compliance with this procedural step is a prerequisite for any claim of default.

Furthermore, DBG Properties has long been aware of our business’s seasonal cash flow patterns, which we have communicated regularly since the start of our lease in September 2020. The rent has been accepted under these circumstances without any formal objection until now, making this sudden change in approach concerning and possibly indicative of other motivations driving the termination.

I look forward to continuing our dialogue and finding a solution that serves both parties equitably.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Option 2: Highlighting Consistency and Reasonable Expectations</strong></h3>

Dear [Landlord’s Name],

I acknowledge that rent has occasionally been late. However, as outlined in Section 24(f) of our lease, DBG Properties is required to provide written notice of default in accordance with Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 for late payments to serve as valid grounds for termination. To date, no such notices have been received for any of the late payments. As a result, the procedural basis for termination under claims of ‘repeated default’ cannot be supported.

It’s also important to recognize that Section 23 of our lease, while protecting the landlord’s right to enforce payment deadlines at any time, does not override the fact that DBG Properties has accepted late payments on 40 out of 45 months without formal objection. Such a consistent practice over nearly the entirety of our tenancy has created a reasonable expectation that payment deadlines were not being enforced with the strictness outlined in the lease.

Furthermore, since the beginning of our lease in September 2020, DBG Properties has been aware of the seasonal variations in our cash flow. This variability has been communicated regularly and rent has been accepted under these conditions until now, with no formal objections or warnings issued. This abrupt shift in position raises concerns and may suggest that there are additional factors influencing this termination decision beyond the procedural grounds cited.

We are open to discussing how to address these concerns and work toward a resolution that benefits both parties.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3>Key Differences:</h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Option 1:</strong> Emphasizes strict adherence to procedural requirements (no written notice), with more focus on legal compliance. It retains a slightly more formal tone and stresses the procedural breakdown while mentioning that the pattern of rent acceptance undermines the sudden termination.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Option 2:</strong> Emphasizes the long-term consistency in the landlord’s behavior, focusing on the reasonable expectations it created. This version also highlights how this sudden shift could raise concerns about hidden motivations, though it’s more subtly stated than in the original. It's written in a slightly less formal tone, which may make it feel more approachable.</ol></li>

                            <div class="message-text">Your combined version is strong and balanced, effectively emphasizing the procedural failings while acknowledging the possible defense related to the non-waiver clause. It provides a clear and professional tone while subtly introducing concerns about the landlord’s sudden change in behavior. 

As for adding a mention about their refusal to accept rent or not being present until the end of business, it could strengthen your case by illustrating that you’ve made good-faith efforts to pay. This could further undermine their claim of repeated default and show that you were willing to meet your obligations, but were hindered by their own actions.

You could include a brief paragraph like this:

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>Additional Clause on Rent Payment Refusal:</strong>  
It is also worth noting that in recent months, we have attempted to make timely rent payments, but there have been instances where DBG Properties was either unavailable to accept payments during standard business hours or refused to accept rent when offered. These circumstances further complicate any claim of default, as we have made good-faith efforts to meet our rental obligations despite the landlord's lack of availability.

<strong>Subject: Response to Termination Notice – Lease Provisions and Procedural Requirements</strong>

Dear [Landlord’s Name],

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar, in violation of Section 7(b) of the lease. This assertion is inaccurate. Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, both operating under the same business and alcohol licenses. Section 7(a) of the lease expressly permits the premises to be used as a restaurant with alcohol service, and we remain fully compliant with all West Virginia regulations governing restaurant operations.

Under West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where at least 60% of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales as secondary. Our business has consistently exceeded this requirement, with more than 60% of our revenue coming from food sales. This clearly qualifies us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar, as your notice suggests.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their meals before departing. This is a common and accepted practice across the industry and does not constitute a violation of either the lease or operating standards.

I trust this clarifies any misunderstanding, and I remain open to discussing any concerns further.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3>Key Enhancements:</h3>

Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Improprieties
 
Dear Matt,
 
I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. After reviewing the claims presented in your notice, including alleged rent defaults, operational non-compliance, and the insurance lapse, I believe there are significant procedural and factual issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, I wish to raise concerns regarding communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively impacting our business.
<ol> 
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Claims of “Repeated Default”</ol></li>
 
While I acknowledge that there have been instances of late rent payments, Section 24(f) of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any written notices of default regarding these late payments, and without such notices, the claim of ‘repeated default’ cannot be procedurally supported. As a result, this basis for termination does not comply with the requirements set forth in our lease agreement.
 
While Section 23 of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, the consistent acceptance of late rent payments over the past 40 months without objection reasonably implies a pattern of behavior. This may have led to an understanding that strict enforcement of payment deadlines was not a priority. While I recognize the non-waiver clause, it’s important to point out that the landlord’s failure to provide the required written notices is the more relevant issue here, as compliance with this procedural step is a prerequisite for any claim of default.
 
Additionally, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations, which we have regularly communicated since we began leasing the space in September 2020. Rent has consistently been accepted under these circumstances until now, without formal objection or concern. This abrupt shift in approach raises questions as to whether other factors may be influencing this sudden termination action.
<ol> 
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</ol></li>
 
Regarding the September and October rent payments, I made good-faith efforts to meet our obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Here are the key details:
 
·       September Rent: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text message that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, on September 25, I received a “Pay or Quit” notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. I attempted to pay before the deadline but was told Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.
 
·       October Rent: I attempted to pay October rent before the 5th of the month, as per our lease terms. However, your office was closed at the time. On October 7, my manager brought $8,000 in cash to cover both September and October rent, but the payment was refused without explanation by your office.
 
These refusals directly prevented me from curing the alleged defaults, despite our attempts to resolve the matter. I am concerned this may reflect an attempt to force a default, rather than a legitimate enforcement of the lease terms.
<ol> 
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</ol></li>
 
Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar, in violation of Section 7(b) of the lease. This assertion is inaccurate. Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, both operating under the same business and alcohol licenses. Section 7(a) of the lease expressly permits the premises to be used as a restaurant with alcohol service, and we remain fully compliant with all West Virginia regulations governing restaurant operations.
 
Under West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where at least 60% of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales as secondary. Our business has consistently exceeded this requirement, with more than 60% of our revenue coming from food sales. This clearly qualifies us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar, as your notice suggests.
 
Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their meals before departing. This is a common and accepted practice across the industry and does not constitute a violation of either the lease or operating standards.
<ol> 
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Insurance Lapse and Rectification</ol></li>
 
Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and notified Sharon at Erie Insurance of the change. Sharon promptly updated two of our policies with the new payment information, but, unfortunately, the third policy was not updated due to an oversight on Erie’s end. We were unaware of this until Matt contacted Erie to inquire about our insurance. At that time, Sharon realized the policy had lapsed and informed us. Since then, we have been actively working to rectify the situation, and we expect the replacement policy to be in effect by this evening or tomorrow at the latest.
 
It is also important to note that under Section 24(a)(ii) of the lease, I am entitled to 30 days to cure non-rent-related breaches, such as an insurance lapse. Since no formal notice of this breach was provided, citing it as immediate grounds for termination is improper.
<ol> 
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Open to Negotiation, but Sufficient Time is Required</ol></li>
 
While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, it is impossible for us to vacate the premises before 2025. At a bare minimum, I would need until the end of January, but in truth, we will likely need until the end of March to make the transition without jeopardizing the business. Any timeline shorter than this would severely undermine the stability of Le Bistro & The Cellar Door and could jeopardize our ability to remain a going concern. Therefore, while I am open to dialogue, I must stress that an expedited move-out date is simply not feasible.
<ol> 
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Resolution Request</ol></li>
 
In light of the procedural flaws and factual inaccuracies discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
 
·       No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.
·       Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing us from curing any alleged defaults.
·       Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of Section 7(a) of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.
·       The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by Section 24(a)(ii).
 
Conclusion
 
I am committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.
 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
 
Sincerely,

I want to send this message but I want to eliminate the idea of getting out by the end of January. it’s also relevant that our lease is up for renewal in September 2025 which is ,relative to the contract, very soon. End of the fiscal year is the only financially sound option or us as our licenses go up for renewal and that would create a scenario where we are not having to pay for two sets of each license. </div>

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Improprieties</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. After reviewing the claims presented in your notice, including alleged rent defaults, operational non-compliance, and the insurance lapse, I believe there are significant procedural and factual issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, I wish to raise concerns regarding communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively impacting our business.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge that there have been instances of late rent payments, Section 24(f) of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any written notices of default regarding these late payments, and without such notices, the claim of ‘repeated default’ cannot be procedurally supported. As a result, this basis for termination does not comply with the requirements set forth in our lease agreement.

While Section 23 of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, the consistent acceptance of late rent payments over the past 40 months without objection reasonably implies a pattern of behavior. This may have led to an understanding that strict enforcement of payment deadlines was not a priority. While I recognize the non-waiver clause, it’s important to point out that the landlord’s failure to provide the required written notices is the more relevant issue here, as compliance with this procedural step is a prerequisite for any claim of default.

Additionally, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations, which we have regularly communicated since we began leasing the space in September 2020. Rent has consistently been accepted under these circumstances until now, without formal objection or concern. This abrupt shift in approach raises questions as to whether other factors may be influencing this sudden termination action.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

Regarding the September and October rent payments, I made good-faith efforts to meet our obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Here are the key details:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text message that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, on September 25, I received a “Pay or Quit” notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. I attempted to pay before the deadline but was told Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay October rent before the 5th of the month, as per our lease terms. However, your office was closed at the time. On October 7, my manager brought $8,000 in cash to cover both September and October rent, but the payment was refused without explanation by your office.</ul></li>

These refusals directly prevented me from curing the alleged defaults, despite our attempts to resolve the matter. I am concerned this may reflect an attempt to enforce a default, rather than legitimate enforcement of the lease terms.

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar, in violation of Section 7(b) of the lease. This assertion is inaccurate. Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, both operating under the same business and alcohol licenses. Section 7(a) of the lease expressly permits the premises to be used as a restaurant with alcohol service, and we remain fully compliant with all West Virginia regulations governing restaurant operations.

Under West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where at least 60% of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales as secondary. Our business has consistently exceeded this requirement, with more than 60% of our revenue coming from food sales. This clearly qualifies us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar, as your notice suggests.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their meals before departing. This is a common and accepted practice across the industry and does not constitute a violation of either the lease or operating standards.

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and notified Sharon at Erie Insurance of the change. Sharon promptly updated two of our policies with the new payment information, but, unfortunately, the third policy was not updated due to an oversight on Erie’s end. We were unaware of this until Matt contacted Erie to inquire about our insurance. At that time, Sharon realized the policy had lapsed and informed us. Since then, we have been actively working to rectify the situation, and we expect the replacement policy to be in effect by this evening or tomorrow at the latest.

It is also important to note that under Section 24(a)(ii) of the lease, I am entitled to 30 days to cure non-rent-related breaches, such as an insurance lapse. Since no formal notice of this breach was provided, citing it as immediate grounds for termination is improper.

<h3>5. Open to Negotiation, but Timing is Critical</h3>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, it is essential to note that our lease is up for renewal in September 2025. Financially, vacating the premises before the end of the fiscal year is the only viable option, as this aligns with our annual license renewals. Moving out sooner would result in the unnecessary cost of paying for two sets of licenses, which would severely strain our business. As such, while I am open to discussing a mutually beneficial resolution, we would need until the end of 2025 to make the transition feasible without jeopardizing our operations.

<h3>6. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural flaws and factual inaccuracies discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing us from curing any alleged defaults.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of Section 7(a) of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by Section 24(a)(ii).</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I am committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This is making it difficult for us to hire new employees, actively resulting in lower sales through the grape vine (i dont know if we should have to explain how that would ultimately result in lower sales, but add in how if you think it would strengthen the argument).

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Improprieties</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. After reviewing the claims presented in your notice, including alleged rent defaults, operational non-compliance, and the insurance lapse, I believe there are significant procedural and factual issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, I wish to raise concerns regarding communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively impacting our business.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge that there have been instances of late rent payments, Section 24(f) of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any written notices of default regarding these late payments, and without such notices, the claim of ‘repeated default’ cannot be procedurally supported. As a result, this basis for termination does not comply with the requirements set forth in our lease agreement.

While Section 23 of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, the consistent acceptance of late rent payments over the past 40 months without objection reasonably implies a pattern of behavior. This may have led to an understanding that strict enforcement of payment deadlines was not a priority. While I recognize the non-waiver clause, it’s important to point out that the landlord’s failure to provide the required written notices is the more relevant issue here, as compliance with this procedural step is a prerequisite for any claim of default.

Additionally, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations, which we have regularly communicated since we began leasing the space in September 2020. Rent has consistently been accepted under these circumstances until now, without formal objection or concern. This abrupt shift in approach raises questions as to whether other factors may be influencing this sudden termination action.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

Regarding the September and October rent payments, I made good-faith efforts to meet our obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Here are the key details:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text message that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, on September 25, I received a “Pay or Quit” notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. I attempted to pay before the deadline but was told Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay October rent before the 5th of the month, as per our lease terms. However, your office was closed at the time.

These refusals directly prevented me from curing the alleged defaults, despite our attempts to resolve the matter. I am concerned this may reflect an attempt to enforce a default, rather than legitimate enforcement of the lease terms.

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar, in violation of Section 7(b) of the lease. This assertion is inaccurate. Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, both operating under the same business and alcohol licenses. Section 7(a) of the lease expressly permits the premises to be used as a restaurant with alcohol service, and we remain fully compliant with all West Virginia regulations governing restaurant operations.

Under West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where at least 60% of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales as secondary. Based on our sales report, the following supergroups contribute to food sales:
<ul>- Brunch
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Catering (Event Room and Off-site)</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Dinner</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Lunch</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Tapas</ul></li>

The supergroups for alcohol sales are:
<ul>- Bistro Beer, Liquor, and Wine
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Tapas Beer, Liquor, and Wine</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Private Selection Wine List</ul></li>

Our business consistently exceeds the 60% food revenue requirement. Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their meals before departing. This is a common and accepted practice across the industry and does not constitute a violation of either the lease or operating standards.

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and notified Sharon at Erie Insurance of the change.

<h3>5. Concerns Regarding Employee Conduct</h3>

It has come to my attention from multiple sources that an employee has been spreading confidential information around Huntington, specifically regarding the details of this lease dispute and falsely implying that we are going to be evicted. This employee’s actions, which I believe you will be able to identify without me naming them, have negatively impacted our ability to hire new employees and, as a result, have contributed to a decline in sales. The spread of such misinformation is harmful to our business and creates an inaccurate perception of our stability, which may have long-term effects on both revenue and our standing within the community.

<h3>6. Open to Negotiation, but Timing is Critical</h3>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, it is essential to note that our lease is up for renewal in September 2025. Financially, the only viable option is to vacate by the end of fiscal year 2025 (June 30, 2025), as this aligns with our annual license renewals. Moving out sooner would result in the unnecessary cost of paying for two sets of licenses, which would severely strain our business. As such, while I am open to discussing a mutually beneficial resolution, we would need until the end of the fiscal year to make this transition feasible without jeopardizing our operations.

<h3>7. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural flaws and factual inaccuracies discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:

Based on our sales report, total food sales are $433,910.57, while total alcohol sales are $185,023.24. This results in <strong>70.11% of our revenue coming from food sales</strong>, well above the 60% threshold required by law. Attached is documentation supporting these numbers, included with the certified letter sent to DBG Properties.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their meals before departing. This is a common and accepted practice across the industry and does not constitute a violation of either the lease or operating standards.

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and notified Sharon at Erie Insurance of the change. Sharon promptly updated two of our policies with the new payment information, but, unfortunately, the third policy was not updated due to an oversight on Erie’s end. We were unaware of this until Matt contacted Erie to inquire about our insurance. At that time, Sharon realized the policy had lapsed and informed us. Since then, we have been actively working to rectify the situation, and we expect the replacement policy to be in effect by this evening or tomorrow at the latest.

It is also important to note that under Section 24(a)(ii) of the lease, I am entitled to 30 days to cure non-rent-related breaches, such as an insurance lapse. Since no formal notice of this breach was provided, citing it as immediate grounds for termination is improper.

<h3>5. Concerns Regarding Employee Conduct</h3>

It has come to my attention from multiple sources that an employee has been spreading confidential information around Huntington, specifically regarding the details of this lease dispute and falsely implying that we are going to be evicted. This employee’s actions, which I believe you will be able to identify without me naming them, have negatively impacted our ability to hire new employees and, as a result, have contributed to a decline in sales. The spread of such misinformation is harmful to our business and creates an inaccurate perception of our stability, which may have long-term effects on both revenue and our standing within the community.

<h3>6. Open to Negotiation, but Timing is Critical</h3>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, it is essential to note that our lease is up for renewal in September 2025. Financially, the only viable option is to vacate by the end of fiscal year 2025 (June 30, 2025), as this aligns with our annual license renewals. Moving out sooner would result in the unnecessary cost of paying for two sets of licenses, which would severely strain our business. As such, while I am open to discussing a mutually beneficial resolution, we would need until the end of the fiscal year to make this transition feasible without jeopardizing our operations.

<h3>7. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural flaws and factual inaccuracies discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing us from curing any alleged defaults.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of Section 7(a) of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by Section 24(a)(ii).</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I am committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy and sales figures, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

                            <div class="message-text">Based on the lease document and the situation you've described, I have identified some critical points:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Rent Cure Period Violation</strong>: Your lease indeed specifies that you have 10 business days to cure any rent default after receiving written notice (Section 24(a)(i) of the lease). The September 30th deadline imposed by DBG Properties without providing the required written notice and cure period violates this provision.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Written Notice for Defaults</strong>: Section 24(f) clarifies that defaults cannot serve as grounds for termination unless written notice was provided for each, along with an opportunity to cure. Given your explanation, DBG has failed to meet this procedural requirement, which supports your claim.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Alcohol Sales and Use Clause</strong>: Section 7(a) permits alcohol service as part of your restaurant operations, and Section 7(b) outlines the terms regarding alcohol service. As long as you continue deriving more than 60% of revenue from food, you are compliant with both state law and the lease, reinforcing your defense against their claims of bar-like operations.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Non-Waiver Clause</strong>: Section 23 of the lease allows the landlord to enforce lease terms even after accepting late payments, but as you've argued, the repeated acceptance of late payments without objection for 40 out of 45 months could indicate a de facto waiver. However, this would only be a secondary defense as the written notice procedure is the stronger argument.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Quiet Enjoyment</strong>: Section 27 assures you peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the premises as long as rent and other obligations are met. The apparent spreading of misinformation by an employee could be construed as an interference with this right, especially if it has harmed your ability to operate, hire, or generate revenue.</ol></li>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Improprieties

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. After reviewing the claims presented in your notice, including alleged rent defaults, operational non-compliance, and the insurance lapse, I believe there are significant procedural and factual issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, I wish to raise concerns regarding communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively impacting our business.

<strong>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</strong>

While I acknowledge that there have been instances of late rent payments, Section 24(f) of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any written notices of default regarding these late payments, and without such notices, the claim of ‘repeated default’ cannot be procedurally supported. This basis for termination is, therefore, invalid.

While Section 23 of the lease includes a non-waiver clause, the acceptance of late rent payments over the past 40 months without objection reasonably implies a pattern of behavior. This may have led to an understanding that strict enforcement of payment deadlines was not a priority. However, the more critical issue is the lack of written notice for defaults, as compliance with this procedural step is necessary for any claim of default.

Moreover, DBG Properties has been aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since we began leasing the space in September 2020, and rent has been accepted without issue until now. The sudden shift in approach raises questions as to whether other factors are influencing this termination action.

<strong>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong>

Regarding the September and October rent payments, I made good-faith efforts to meet our obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Here are the key details:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><em>September Rent</em>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, I received a “Pay or Quit” notice demanding $4,600 by September 30, which is in violation of the lease’s provision allowing me 10 days to cure any default. I attempted to pay but was told Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><em>October Rent</em>: I attempted to pay October rent before the 5th of the month, but your office was closed. On October 7, my manager brought $8,000 in cash for both September and October rent, but the payment was refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals prevented me from curing the alleged defaults, reflecting an attempt to enforce a default, rather than legitimate enforcement of lease terms.

<strong>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</strong>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar, in violation of Section 7(b) of the lease. This is inaccurate. We comply with Section 7(a), which allows alcohol service as part of our restaurant operations, and we adhere to West Virginia Code §60-7-2, with more than 60% of revenue coming from food sales, not alcohol. This clearly qualifies us as a restaurant under state law.

<strong>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</strong>

We acknowledge the brief lapse in one of our required policies due to an oversight by Erie Insurance. This policy is being reinstated, and we expect full coverage to be active by this evening. Furthermore, Section 24(a)(ii) entitles me to 30 days to cure such a breach, and no formal notice of this breach was provided.

<strong>5. External Communications Impacting Our Business</strong>

I have also been made aware, through multiple sources, that an employee of DBG Properties has been spreading information in Huntington that we are facing eviction, without regard for the actual facts. This has negatively affected our ability to hire and has harmed our business reputation. We consider this interference a breach of our right to quiet enjoyment under Section 27 of the lease, and it has contributed to a decline in sales.

<strong>6. Open to Negotiation, but Time is Required</strong>

While I am open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by the end of the fiscal year, June 30, 2025. This date aligns with our financial commitments, including license renewals, and avoids the burden of paying for two sets of licenses.

<strong>7. Resolution Request</strong>

In light of the procedural flaws and factual inaccuracies discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>- No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of the lease and state law.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided.</ul></li>

I have attached documentation supporting all claims made in this letter.

I hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice.

<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> of your lease gives you 10 business days to cure any rent default after receiving written notice of default. The “Pay or Quit” notice that demanded payment by September 30 did not provide you with this required 10-day cure period, making the demand in violation of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Section 24(f)</strong>, referenced in their notice, states that any rent default that is repeated twice in a 12-month period could be grounds for termination, but only if the default was properly noticed in writing and the cure period was allowed. Since no prior written notices of default were provided, this clause does not apply in this situation.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of your lease outlines that you may not operate the premises solely as a bar or sell alcohol outside the permitted hours. However, your compliance with West Virginia’s food sales percentage (above 60%) and cessation of alcohol service at the appropriate times means you are in line with this provision.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Section 15(b)</strong> discusses insurance requirements, but as per your explanation, you have rectified the insurance lapse, and no formal notice was given before they acted on this.</ol></li>

Now that I have reviewed everything, I’ll adjust the letter to reference these specific sections clearly and accurately, also ensuring all claims made in the letter are supported by the lease terms.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge that there have been instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> of our lease gives us 10 business days to cure any default after receiving written notice. The September 25 "Pay or Quit" notice you issued, demanding payment by September 30, failed to provide the required 10-day cure period, violating this provision of the lease. Furthermore, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> requires that defaults be repeated twice in a 12-month period, and written notice must have been provided for each default. No prior written notices have been issued to us. As such, this basis for termination is invalid.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 24(a)(i):</strong> "In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default prior to Landlord having the right to terminate this Lease or take other appropriate action."  

<strong>Section 24(f):</strong> "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Lease, if Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other charge provided for or required in this Lease when and as the same shall become due, and if any such default shall be repeated twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, then, notwithstanding that each such default shall have been cured by Tenant as provided in this Lease, any further similar default within said twelve (12) month period shall be deemed to be a repeated default without the ability to cure. In the event of a repeated default, Landlord, upon prior written notice to Tenant, may terminate this Lease forthwith and Landlord may, at its option, avail itself of any and all remedies set forth in this Lease or as provided by law."  

While Section 23 of the lease includes a non-waiver clause, your consistent acceptance of late rent payments without objection for 40 out of 45 months reasonably implies a <strong>de facto waiver</strong> of strict payment enforcement. This pattern of behavior suggests that enforcement of payment deadlines was not prioritized, which establishes a reasonable expectation of flexibility on our part. However, the primary issue remains that the required written notices for these defaults were never provided, making your claims procedurally invalid.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 23:</strong> "No waiver of any condition or covenant of this Lease shall be implied or construed by the failure of Landlord to declare a default for any violation or breach of such condition or covenant if such violation or breach be continued or repeated. No express waiver shall affect any condition or covenant other than the one specified in such waiver, and that one only for the time and in the manner specifically stated."

Additionally, DBG Properties has been aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since we began leasing the space in September 2020, and rent has been accepted without issue until now. The sudden shift in approach raises questions as to whether other factors are influencing this termination action.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

Regarding the September and October rent payments, I made good-faith efforts to meet our obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Here are the key details:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, I received a “Pay or Quit” notice demanding $4,600 by September 30, which is in violation of the lease’s provision allowing me 10 business days to cure any default. I attempted to pay but was told Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay October rent before the 5th of the month, but your office was closed. On October 7, my manager brought $8,000 in cash for both September and October rent, but the payment was refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals prevented me from curing the alleged defaults, reflecting an attempt to enforce a default, rather than legitimate enforcement of lease terms.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: "In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default prior to Landlord having the right to terminate this Lease or take other appropriate action."

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar, in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This is inaccurate. We comply with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, which allows alcohol service as part of our restaurant operations, and we adhere to West Virginia Code §60-7-2, which requires that at least 60% of revenue come from food sales. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11% of our total revenue comes from food sales</strong>, with $433,910.57 in food sales compared to $185,023.24 in alcohol sales. This clearly qualifies us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar. Attached to this letter is documentation verifying these sales figures.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 7(a):</strong> "Tenant covenants and agrees to use the Premises solely for the operation of a restaurant and may serve alcoholic beverages in conjunction with its food service operations, provided that the sale of food constitutes the primary source of revenue and alcoholic beverages shall be served in compliance with all applicable state and local laws."  

<strong>Section 7(b):</strong> "Tenant covenants and agrees (i) never to operate the Premises as a bar or sell alcohol on or from the Premises except as expressly allowed in this paragraph (b), and (ii) to cease conducting business and close each day by no later than 11:00 o'clock p.m. on Sunday through Thursday, inclusive, and by no later than midnight on Friday and Saturday..."

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

We acknowledge the brief lapse in one of our required policies due to an oversight by Erie Insurance. This policy is being reinstated, and we expect full coverage to be active by this evening. Furthermore, <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> entitles me to 30 days to cure such a breach, and no formal notice of this breach was provided.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 24(a)(ii):</strong> "If Tenant shall fail to maintain insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such failure and Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure such failure."

<h3>5. External Communications Impacting Our Business</h3>

I have also been made aware, through multiple sources, that an employee of DBG Properties has been spreading information in Huntington that we are facing eviction, without regard for the actual facts. This has negatively affected our ability to hire and has harmed our business reputation. We consider this interference a breach of our right to quiet enjoyment under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease, and it has contributed to a decline in sales.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 27:</strong> "Landlord covenants that, upon Tenant paying the rent and performing the covenants herein required of Tenant, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Premises for the term of this Lease."

<h3>6. Open to Negotiation, but Time is Required</h3>

While I am open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by the end of the fiscal year, <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This date aligns with our financial commitments, including license renewals, and avoids the burden of paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>7. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural flaws and factual inaccuracies discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>- No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of the lease and state law.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided.</ul></li>

I have attached documentation supporting all claims made in this letter.

I hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

                            <div class="message-text">“1. Certified Mail Requirement for Notices (Section 36 of the Lease)

Section 36 of your lease clearly states that any notice, including default or termination, must be sent via “certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested” or by a recognized courier. This provision is crucial because it sets the standard for all official communications between the parties.

Relevance to the Case:

	•	The termination notice from DBG Properties does not reference a certified mail receipt or evidence of registered delivery in the provided documents.
	•	The notices you received may not meet the formal notice requirements if delivered informally, and this is a strong defense against the lease’s termination.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Cure Period for Rent Defaults (Section 24(a)(i))</ol></li>

Your lease specifies that you have 10 business days to cure any rent default after receiving written notice. The “Pay or Quit” notice provided on September 25, 2024, demanded payment by September 30, which only allowed five days. This violates the lease terms.

Relevance to the Case:

	•	The notice did not provide the correct cure period as required by the lease, making the termination notice on October 1, 2024, premature and invalid.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Repeated Default Clause (Section 24(f))</ol></li>

The lease outlines that a default must be repeated twice within 12 months, with prior written notice, before the landlord can terminate without a cure option.

Relevance to the Case:

	•	There is no evidence of prior written default notices before the September 25 notice. Therefore, DBG Properties cannot establish a “repeated default” basis for termination.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Operational Non-Compliance and Use of the Premises (Section 7)</ol></li>

Your lease specifies that the premises must be operated as a restaurant and not a bar, with alcohol service allowed as part of the restaurant operations. You have documented that over 70% of your sales are from food, which aligns with both the lease and state law requirements.

Relevance to the Case:

	•	Your compliance with food sales exceeding 60% directly refutes any claim that you are operating as a bar in violation of Section 7. This should be presented as evidence of your adherence to the lease’s terms.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Insurance Lapse (Section 15 and 24(a)(ii))</ol></li>

The lease provides you with 30 days to cure an insurance lapse after written notice. You acknowledged a brief lapse but rectified it promptly. No formal written notice was provided regarding this issue, which violates the landlord’s obligations.

Relevance to the Case:

	•	Without proper written notice, the insurance lapse cannot serve as a valid basis for lease termination.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Quiet Enjoyment and External Communications (Section 27)</ol></li>

The lease guarantees your right to quiet enjoyment of the premises as long as rent is paid and lease obligations are met. The negative information spread by DBG staff about your potential eviction may constitute a breach of this right, as it harms your business.

Relevance to the Case:

	•	You could potentially pursue a claim of interference with your right to quiet enjoyment due to the impact on your business reputation and operations.

Court Outlook:

Given the procedural and factual violations by DBG Properties (improper notice methods, failure to honor cure periods, lack of prior default notices), you have a strong position to challenge the termination in court. Courts generally uphold lease provisions requiring proper notice and procedural fairness. The informal and incomplete approach taken by DBG Properties significantly weakens their case.

Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations

Dear Matt,

I am writing to formally respond to your Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. I believe the notice contains several procedural errors and factual inaccuracies that invalidate the termination. I am committed to resolving this matter amicably, but I must address the following points based on our lease agreement:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Violation of Certified Mail Requirement (Section 36)</ol></li>

The lease requires that all notices be sent via certified mail or registered mail, with return receipt requested, or by a recognized courier. I have not received any termination or default notices through such methods, as stipulated by the lease. This failure alone renders the termination procedurally invalid.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Failure to Provide Adequate Cure Period for Rent Default (Section 24(a)(i))</ol></li>

Your “Pay or Quit” notice dated September 25, 2024, only allowed five days to cure the alleged rent default, which is inconsistent with the 10 business day cure period required under the lease. As I was still within the cure period, the termination notice issued on October 1, 2024, is premature and unenforceable.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">No Basis for “Repeated Default” (Section 24(f))</ol></li>

For a repeated default to occur, there must be at least two prior rent defaults within a 12-month period, each with formal written notice. No such prior notices were issued. Therefore, this ground for termination cannot be substantiated.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Compliance with Operational Terms (Section 7)</ol></li>

Your claim that we are operating as a bar is incorrect. According to our sales data, over 70% of our revenue is derived from food sales, in compliance with both the lease and West Virginia law. Documentation supporting these figures is attached.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Insurance Lapse and Cure Period (Section 24(a)(ii))</ol></li>

Although there was a brief lapse in one insurance policy, it has been rectified. The lease entitles me to 30 days to cure such issues after written notice. Since no formal notice was issued, this claim cannot support the termination.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications (Section 27)</ol></li>

I am aware of communications by your staff suggesting that we are facing eviction, which has negatively impacted our business. This conduct interferes with our right to quiet enjoyment under the lease and has caused reputational damage.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Resolution Request</ol></li>

In light of these procedural and factual issues, I respectfully request that the termination notice be retracted. I remain open to negotiating an early termination, provided we can agree to terms that align with our financial commitments and operations through June 2025.

I look forward to your response and hope we can resolve these matters amicably.

Sincerely,
Christopher Craven
President, Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.

Changes from Your Original Draft:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Added Certified Mail Emphasis: Highlighted that notices were not delivered as required under Section 36 of the lease, strengthening your procedural defense.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Clarified Rent Cure Period: Further emphasized the premature termination, detailing the violation of the 10-day cure period.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Expanded on Insurance Lapse: Addressed the 30-day cure period for the insurance lapse and the lack of formal notice.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Right to Quiet Enjoyment: Strengthened the claim regarding harmful communications affecting your business.</ol></li>

Let me know if you’d like further adjustments!”

The above response is fro the law gpt that is incorporated into this app. Overall, I like your response better than the one i got from the law response, but i want you to review its response and ensure there aren’t any details from it that result in you wanting to change your draft letter to DBG. Before providing an updated letter, give me your answer this. </div>

                            <div class="message-text">After reviewing the law GPT response you provided, I can confirm that most of the points it raises are already covered in our draft. However, there are a few additional elements from its response that could enhance the overall structure and clarity of your letter. Here's what I think could be incorporated or adjusted:

<h3>Additional Elements to Include:</h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Certified Mail Requirement (Section 36)</strong>: </ol>
   The emphasis on certified mail as the only proper method for delivering notices is a strong procedural defense. Explicitly stating that DBG Properties did not use certified mail (or provide proof of it) would add weight to your argument about improper notice. This would reinforce that the termination notice is invalid based on this alone.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Quiet Enjoyment (Section 27)</strong>:</ol></li>
   The law GPT response puts more emphasis on the idea that harmful communications by DBG Properties staff interfere with your right to quiet enjoyment. While I included this in your draft, I think I could elevate the language to make it clear that the staff's actions are not just inappropriate, but could constitute a breach of the lease, potentially giving you grounds for further action if necessary.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Clearer Structure</strong>:</ol></li>
   The law GPT response breaks down each issue more clearly by giving each point a short title (e.g., "Certified Mail Requirement", "Cure Period", "Repeated Default Clause"). While our draft covers these topics thoroughly, using headers like this might help make each argument more digestible for the recipient.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Court Outlook / Negotiation Strength</strong>:</ol></li>
   The law GPT response mentions a “court outlook,” which reminds the recipient that courts generally side with tenants when there are clear procedural violations by landlords. We can introduce a subtle line about how these procedural errors weaken DBG's case, making it clear that challenging the termination would be a strong option if they do not retract it.

<h3>Updated Plan:</h3>
<ul>- I’ll add the <strong>Certified Mail Requirement</strong> section and directly reference Section 36 of the lease, with an emphasis on the fact that the termination notice lacks proof of certified delivery.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">I’ll revise the <strong>Quiet Enjoyment</strong> section to clearly state that the harmful communications from DBG staff interfere with your right to peaceful enjoyment, which may give rise to further action.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">I’ll restructure the letter with short titles for each section, similar to the law GPT structure, to improve clarity and flow.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">I’ll briefly reference the <strong>weakening of DBG’s case</strong> due to their procedural errors, reminding them of the risk of this going to court.</ul></li>

I believe these changes will make the letter even stronger. Let me know if you want to proceed with this plan, and I'll update the draft accordingly!</div>

<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Trade Fixtures</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - It's important to clearly define that <strong>trade fixtures</strong> include your custom bar, furniture, and equipment, and any such fixtures that are considered part of the business will be removed if the lease is terminated.

You’ll want to reinforce that you have stored and maintained these items for reinstallation if necessary.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>False Claims</strong>:</ol></li>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your latest Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, which I received via certified mail. While I acknowledge that this recent notice complies with the lease’s requirements for certified delivery, I must point out that the original notice, dated October 1, 2024, did <strong>not</strong> follow this procedure, and therefore cannot be considered valid for enforcing immediate termination.

<h3>1. Procedural and Factual Inaccuracies in the Original Notice</h3>

Your first notice, dated October 1, 2024, was not delivered via certified mail, as required under <strong>Section 36</strong> of our lease, which stipulates that all notices must be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by recognized courier. Without compliance with this delivery requirement, any attempt to terminate the lease at that time was invalid.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 36:</strong> "All notices, requests, and other communications shall be sent via certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by recognized overnight courier service."

<h3>2. Cure Period for Rent Defaults</h3>

The notice you delivered on September 25, 2024, demanding payment by September 30, did not provide the 10 business days required under <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> of the lease. As such, the October 1 termination notice was premature and invalid, as I was still within the allowed cure period.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 24(a)(i):</strong> "In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default prior to Landlord having the right to terminate this Lease or take other appropriate action."

<h3>3. Repeated Default Allegation</h3>

The new notice references the "repeated default" clause in <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of the lease. However, as there were no prior written notices regarding any defaults within the past 12 months, this allegation cannot be substantiated.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 24(f):</strong> "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Lease, if Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other charge provided for or required in this Lease when and as the same shall become due, and if any such default shall be repeated twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, then, notwithstanding that each such default shall have been cured by Tenant as provided in this Lease, any further similar default within said twelve (12) month period shall be deemed to be a repeated default without the ability to cure."

<h3>4. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

The latest termination notice makes the incorrect claim that our business is operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. As demonstrated by our sales data, <strong>70.11% of our revenue is derived from food sales</strong>, in compliance with both the lease and West Virginia law. I have attached documentation supporting these figures.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 7(b):</strong> "Tenant covenants and agrees (i) never to operate the Premises as a bar or sell alcohol on or from the Premises except as expressly allowed in this paragraph (b)..."

<h3>5. Trade Fixtures and Property at Lease Termination</h3>

I also want to clarify that, should the lease be terminated, the definition of <strong>trade fixtures</strong> in the lease includes items such as our custom bar, furniture, and equipment that we have installed in both restaurant spaces. We will ensure that all trade fixtures and business equipment are removed in accordance with the lease, and all original fixtures, such as the old lighting and wall medallions, will be reinstalled as they were when we began leasing the premises.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 11(e):</strong> "Upon the termination or expiration of this Lease, all improvements, Tenant Alterations, and additions placed on the Premises or affixed thereto by Tenant (other than Tenant's signage, trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment) shall become the property of Landlord without any obligation of further payment on the part of Landlord."

<h3>6. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

While the lease entitles me to 30 days to cure an insurance lapse after receiving written notice, no such formal notice was provided before the October 8 termination letter. The brief lapse in one of our insurance policies has been rectified, and this alleged breach cannot serve as a valid basis for termination.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 24(a)(ii):</strong> "If Tenant shall fail to maintain insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such failure and Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure such failure."

<h3>7. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

Finally, I must address the ongoing issue of harmful communications by your staff regarding our potential eviction. These actions have damaged our reputation and hindered our ability to hire new employees, thus interfering with our right to quiet enjoyment under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease.

<em>Relevant Lease Excerpt</em>  
<strong>Section 27:</strong> "Landlord covenants that, upon Tenant paying the rent and performing the covenants herein required of Tenant, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Premises for the term of this Lease."

<h3>Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural and factual issues raised above, I respectfully request that the termination notice be retracted. I remain open to discussing an early termination that aligns with our financial commitments, including vacating by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>, but only under mutually agreed terms that ensure compliance with the lease.

I hope we can resolve this matter amicably. Please confirm receipt of this letter and your intentions regarding the retraction of the termination notice.

““Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. After reviewing the claims presented in your notice, including alleged rent defaults, operational non-compliance, and the insurance lapse, I believe there are significant procedural and factual issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, I wish to raise concerns regarding communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively impacting our business.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Claims of “Repeated Default”</ol></li>

While I acknowledge that there have been instances of late rent payments, Section 24(f) of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any written notices of default regarding these late payments, and without such notices, the claim of ‘repeated default’ cannot be procedurally supported. As a result, this basis for termination does not comply with the requirements set forth in our lease agreement.

While Section 23 of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, the consistent acceptance of late rent payments over the past 40 months without objection reasonably implies a pattern of behavior. This may have led to an understanding that strict enforcement of payment deadlines was not a priority. While I recognize the non-waiver clause, it’s important to point out that the landlord’s failure to provide the required written notices is the more relevant issue here, as compliance with this procedural step is a prerequisite for any claim of default.

Additionally, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations, which we have regularly communicated since we began leasing the space in September 2020. Rent has consistently been accepted under these circumstances until now, without formal objection or concern. This abrupt shift in approach raises questions as to whether other factors may be influencing this sudden termination action.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</ol></li>

Regarding the September and October rent payments, I made good-faith efforts to meet our obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Here are the key details:

	•	September Rent: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text message that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, on September 25, I received a “Pay or Quit” notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. I attempted to pay before the deadline but was told Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.
	•	October Rent: I attempted to pay October rent before the 5th of the month, as per our lease terms. However, your office was closed at the time. On October 7, my manager brought $8,000 in cash to cover both September and October rent, but the payment was refused without explanation by your office.

These refusals directly prevented me from curing the alleged defaults, despite our attempts to resolve the matter. I am concerned this may reflect an attempt to enforce a default, rather than legitimate enforcement of the lease terms.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</ol></li>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar, in violation of Section 7(b) of the lease. This assertion is inaccurate. Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, both operating under the same business and alcohol licenses. Section 7(a) of the lease expressly permits the premises to be used as a restaurant with alcohol service, and we remain fully compliant with all West Virginia regulations governing restaurant operations.

Under West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where at least 60% of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales as secondary. Our business has consistently exceeded this requirement, with more than 60% of our revenue coming from food sales. This clearly qualifies us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar, as your notice suggests.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their meals before departing. This is a common and accepted practice across the industry and does not constitute a violation of either the lease or operating standards.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Insurance Lapse and Rectification</ol></li>

Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and notified Sharon at Erie Insurance of the change. Sharon promptly updated two of our policies with the new payment information, but, unfortunately, the third policy was not updated due to an oversight on Erie’s end. We were unaware of this until Matt contacted Erie to inquire about our insurance. At that time, Sharon realized the policy had lapsed and informed us. Since then, we have been actively working to rectify the situation, and we expect the replacement policy to be in effect by this evening or tomorrow at the latest.

It is also important to note that under Section 24(a)(ii) of the lease, I am entitled to 30 days to cure non-rent-related breaches, such as an insurance lapse. Since no formal notice of this breach was provided, citing it as immediate grounds for termination is improper.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Open to Negotiation, but Sufficient Time is Required</ol></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, it is impossible for us to vacate the premises before 2025. At a bare minimum, I would need until the end of January, but in truth, we will likely need until the end of March to make the transition without jeopardizing the business. Any timeline shorter than this would severely undermine the stability of Le Bistro & The Cellar Door and could jeopardize our ability to remain a going concern. Therefore, while I am open to dialogue, I must stress that an expedited move-out date is simply not feasible.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Resolution Request</ol></li>

In light of the procedural flaws and factual inaccuracies discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:

	•	No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.
	•	Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing us from curing any alleged defaults.
	•	Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of Section 7(a) of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.
	•	The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by Section 24(a)(ii).

Conclusion

I am committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Improprieties

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. After reviewing the claims presented in your notice, including alleged rent defaults, operational non-compliance, and the insurance lapse, I believe there are significant procedural and factual issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, I wish to raise concerns regarding communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively impacting our business.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Claims of “Repeated Default”</ol></li>

While I acknowledge that there have been instances of late rent payments, Section 24(a)(i) of our lease gives us 10 business days to cure any default after receiving written notice. The September 25 “Pay or Quit” notice you issued, demanding payment by September 30, failed to provide the required 10-day cure period, violating this provision of the lease. Furthermore, Section 24(f) requires that defaults be repeated twice in a 12-month period, and written notice must have been provided for each default. No prior written notices have been issued to us. As such, this basis for termination is invalid.

Relevant Lease Excerpt
Section 24(a)(i): “In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default prior to Landlord having the right to terminate this Lease or take other appropriate action.”

Section 24(f): “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Lease, if Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other charge provided for or required in this Lease when and as the same shall become due, and if any such default shall be repeated twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, then, notwithstanding that each such default shall have been cured by Tenant as provided in this Lease, any further similar default within said twelve (12) month period shall be deemed to be a repeated default without the ability to cure. In the event of a repeated default, Landlord, upon prior written notice to Tenant, may terminate this Lease forthwith and Landlord may, at its option, avail itself of any and all remedies set forth in this Lease or as provided by law.”

While Section 23 of the lease includes a non-waiver clause, your consistent acceptance of late rent payments without objection for 40 out of 45 months reasonably implies a de facto waiver of strict payment enforcement. This pattern of behavior suggests that enforcement of payment deadlines was not prioritized, which establishes a reasonable expectation of flexibility on our part. However, the primary issue remains that the required written notices for these defaults were never provided, making your claims procedurally invalid.

Relevant Lease Excerpt
Section 23: “No waiver of any condition or covenant of this Lease shall be implied or construed by the failure of Landlord to declare a default for any violation or breach of such condition or covenant if such violation or breach be continued or repeated. No express waiver shall affect any condition or covenant other than the one specified in such waiver, and that one only for the time and in the manner specifically stated.”

Additionally, DBG Properties has been aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since we began leasing the space in September 2020, and rent has been accepted without issue until now. The sudden shift in approach raises questions as to whether other factors are influencing this termination action.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</ol></li>

Regarding the September and October rent payments, I made good-faith efforts to meet our obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Here are the key details:

	•	September Rent: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, I received a “Pay or Quit” notice demanding $4,600 by September 30, which is in violation of the lease’s provision allowing me 10 business days to cure any default. I attempted to pay but was told Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.
	•	October Rent: I attempted to pay October rent before the 5th of the month, but your office was closed. On October 7, my manager brought $8,000 in cash for both September and October rent, but the payment was refused without explanation.

These refusals prevented me from curing the alleged defaults, reflecting an attempt to enforce a default, rather than legitimate enforcement of lease terms.

Relevant Lease Excerpt
Section 24(a)(i): “In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default prior to Landlord having the right to terminate this Lease or take other appropriate action.”
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</ol></li>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar, in violation of Section 7(b) of the lease. This is inaccurate. We comply with Section 7(a), which allows alcohol service as part of our restaurant operations, and we adhere to West Virginia Code §60-7-2, which requires that at least 60% of revenue come from food sales. Based on our sales data, 70.11% of our total revenue comes from food sales, with $433,910.57 in food sales compared to $185,023.24 in alcohol sales. This clearly qualifies us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar. Attached to this letter is documentation verifying these sales figures.

Relevant Lease Excerpt
Section 7(a): “Tenant covenants and agrees to use the Premises solely for the operation of a restaurant and may serve alcoholic beverages in conjunction with its food service operations, provided that the sale of food constitutes the primary source of revenue and alcoholic beverages shall be served in compliance with all applicable state and local laws.”

Section 7(b): “Tenant covenants and agrees (i) never to operate the Premises as a bar or sell alcohol on or from the Premises except as expressly allowed in this paragraph (b), and (ii) to cease conducting business and close each day by no later than 11:00 o’clock p.m. on Sunday through Thursday, inclusive, and by no later than midnight on Friday and Saturday…”
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Insurance Lapse and Rectification</ol></li>

We acknowledge the brief lapse in one of our required policies due to an oversight by Erie Insurance. This policy is being reinstated, and we expect full coverage to be active by this evening. Furthermore, Section 24(a)(ii) entitles me to 30 days to cure such a breach, and no formal notice of this breach was provided.

Relevant Lease Excerpt
Section 24(a)(ii): “If Tenant shall fail to maintain insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such failure and Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure such failure.”
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">External Communications Impacting Our Business</ol></li>

I have also been made aware, through multiple sources, that an employee of DBG Properties has been spreading information in Huntington that we are facing eviction, without regard for the actual facts. This has negatively affected our ability to hire and has harmed our business reputation. We consider this interference a breach of our right to quiet enjoyment under Section 27 of the lease, and it has contributed to a decline in sales.

Relevant Lease Excerpt
Section 27: “Landlord covenants that, upon Tenant paying the rent and performing the covenants herein required of Tenant, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Premises for the term of this Lease.”
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Open to Negotiation, but Time is Required</ol></li>

While I am open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by the end of the fiscal year, June 30, 2025. This date aligns with our financial commitments, including license renewals, and avoids the burden of paying for two sets of licenses.
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Resolution Request</ol></li>

In light of the procedural flaws and factual inaccuracies discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:

	•	No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.
	•	Good-faith rent payments were actively refused.
	•	Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of the lease and state law.
	•	The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided.

I have attached documentation supporting all claims made in this letter.

I hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your <strong>Notice of Lease Termination</strong> dated October 8, 2024, which I received via certified mail. While I acknowledge that this notice complies with the lease’s requirements for certified delivery, I must point out several procedural and factual issues that need addressing. I also wish to raise concerns regarding the impact of external communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively affecting our business operations.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge there have been instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any prior written notices of default regarding these late payments. Without such notices, the claim of “repeated default” cannot be procedurally supported and is thus invalid.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpts:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(f)</strong>: <em>"If Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other charge... and if any such default shall be repeated twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, then... upon prior written notice to Tenant, Landlord may terminate this Lease forthwith..."</em></ul></li>

While <strong>Section 23</strong> of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, DBG Properties' consistent acceptance of late rent payments for <strong>40 out of the past 45 months</strong> without objection reasonably implies a <strong>de facto waiver</strong> of strict enforcement. This pattern of behavior suggests that an understanding was established between the parties regarding the flexible enforcement of payment deadlines. However, the primary issue remains that the required written notices for these defaults were never provided, making any claim of default unsupported.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 23</strong>: <em>"No waiver of any condition or covenant of this Lease shall be implied or construed by the failure of Landlord to declare a default for any violation or breach of such condition..."</em></ul></li>

DBG Properties has also been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since the start of our lease in <strong>September 2020</strong>, and these variations were communicated regularly. Rent was consistently accepted under these circumstances until now. The abrupt shift in enforcement raises concerns about the motivation behind this sudden termination.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

I made good-faith efforts to meet our rent obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, on <strong>September 25</strong>, I received a <strong>Pay or Quit</strong> notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. I attempted to pay before the deadline, but I was informed that Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay the October rent before the 5th of the month as required by our lease. However, your office was closed at the time. On <strong>October 7</strong>, my manager brought <strong>$8,000 in cash</strong> to cover both September and October rent, but this payment was refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals directly prevented me from curing the alleged defaults. It appears that these actions were intended to enforce a default, rather than adhere to legitimate enforcement of the lease terms.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">

<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Insurance Lapse and Cure Period</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - I’ve added a detailed explanation of the insurance lapse, including how it was rectified and why it cannot serve as grounds for termination without formal written notice, in compliance with Section 24(a)(ii).</ul>

<ul>   - The communication by DBG Properties' staff and the resulting damage to your business, along with its impact on hiring and sales, has been covered under Section 27 of the lease.</ul>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your <strong>Notice of Lease Termination</strong> dated October 8, 2024, which I received via certified mail. While I acknowledge that this notice complies with the lease’s requirements for certified delivery, I must point out several procedural and factual issues that need addressing.

While I acknowledge there have been instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination.

<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your October 8 notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This assertion is factually incorrect. Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, and both operate under the same business and alcohol licenses, as permitted under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease.

West Virginia Code §60-7-2 defines a restaurant as an establishment where at least <strong>60%</strong> of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales being secondary. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11%</strong> of our revenue is derived from food sales, with $433,910.57 in food sales compared to $185,023.24 in alcohol sales. These figures clearly qualify us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar, as your notice suggests. I have attached documentation verifying these sales figures.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their meals before departing. This is a common industry practice and does not constitute a violation of the lease or operating standards.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpts:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(a)</strong>: <em>"Tenant covenants and agrees to use the Premises solely for the operation of a restaurant and may serve alcoholic beverages in conjunction with its food service operations, provided that the sale of food constitutes the primary source of revenue..."</em></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(b)</strong>: <em>"Tenant covenants and agrees (i) never to operate the Premises as a bar or sell alcohol on or from the Premises except as expressly allowed in this paragraph..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed due to an oversight. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and promptly notified Erie Insurance. While Erie updated two of our policies with the new payment information, unfortunately, the third policy was not updated due to an administrative error on their end. Once this issue was brought to our attention, we took immediate steps to rectify the situation. We expect the new policy to be in effect no later than tomorrow.

It’s important to note that under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease, I am entitled to <strong>30 days</strong> to cure a non-rent-related breach, such as an insurance lapse. Since no formal written notice of this breach was provided, citing it as grounds for immediate termination is improper.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>: <em>"If Tenant shall fail to maintain insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such failure and Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure such failure..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>5. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

I have been made aware through multiple sources that an employee of DBG Properties has been spreading information around Huntington that we are facing eviction, without regard to the actual facts or context of this situation. This communication is already affecting our ability to hire new staff, and the uncertainty has negatively impacted sales. These actions represent an interference with our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease, which guarantees our peaceful enjoyment of the premises as long as rent and other obligations are met.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 27</strong>: <em>"Landlord covenants that, upon Tenant paying the rent and performing the covenants herein required of Tenant, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Premises for the term of this Lease..."</em></ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
That’s the finalized portion up to this point. Now, I’m working on:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Trade Fixtures and Property</strong> – Detailing your rights over your custom bar, furniture, and other equipment as trade fixtures.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Resolution Request and Conclusion</strong> – To close out the letter with a firm but professional request for retracting the termination notice.</ol></li>

<ul>   - Clearly stating your right to remove trade fixtures like your custom bar, furniture, and equipment, and acknowledging that you will re-install any original fixtures (e.g., lighting) when you vacate, in accordance with the lease.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Resolution Request and Conclusion</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Firmly requesting a retraction of the termination notice and offering a clear path forward, such as vacating by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>, which aligns with your financial commitments and license renewals.</ul>

                            <div class="message-text">Great point about the lease not explicitly defining "trade fixtures." Here’s the strategy I propose to address this:

<h3><strong>1. Rely on Legal Precedent and Common Interpretation:</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Trade fixtures</strong> are a well-understood legal concept, even if not specifically defined in the lease. Courts generally interpret trade fixtures as items that a tenant installs for the purpose of conducting business and that can be removed without causing significant damage to the property (e.g., bars, shelving, kitchen equipment).
<li class="list-disc ml-6">I will emphasize the common understanding of trade fixtures as applied in commercial lease contexts, particularly in industries like restaurants where custom-built furniture and equipment are integral to operations.</ul></li>

<h3><strong>2. Frame It as a Customary Practice:</strong></h3>
<ul>   - I’ll state that your custom bar, furniture, and equipment are essential to running your restaurant and thus qualify as trade fixtures, and that removing them is in line with standard industry practices.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Additionally, I'll clarify that you will ensure the premises are restored to their original state by re-installing the landlord's original fixtures (like lighting), making it clear you're honoring the lease.</ul></li>

<h3><strong>3. Reinforce This with Proactive Cooperation:</strong></h3>
<ul>   - I'll offer to discuss any specific fixtures that might fall into a gray area to reinforce your willingness to comply with both the lease and customary expectations. This shows you’re being proactive and reasonable, which strengthens your position.</ul>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
I'll add this reasoning into the section about trade fixtures. Does this strategy align with your expectations, or would you like to approach it differently?</div>

                            <div class="message-text">Yes, you’re exactly right. For any fixtures where you don’t have the originals, replacing them with something comparable that doesn’t damage the space is the appropriate strategy. Since The Cellar Door was originally an empty basement, there is some flexibility in terms of what “comparable” means. The key here is ensuring you leave the space in a condition that adheres to the general obligations under the lease (e.g., no unnecessary damage) while not over-investing in costly replacements.

<h3>In the letter:</h3>
<ol>1. I’ll explain that, where the original fixtures no longer exist, you will replace them with items that are comparable in function and design to what was previously in place.
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">I’ll also make sure we emphasize that <strong>ARI</strong> made substantial investments into the space and that you’re ensuring compliance while protecting your own investment in trade fixtures.</ol></li>

I’ll include these points in the next section and ensure it’s covered fully in the final draft. You’re making a strong case by showing reasonableness and adherence to standard practices. I’ll get the updated draft to you shortly!</div>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your <strong>Notice of Lease Termination</strong> dated October 8, 2024, which I received via certified mail. While I acknowledge that this notice complies with the lease’s requirements for certified delivery, I must point out several procedural and factual issues that need addressing. I also wish to raise concerns regarding the impact of external communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively affecting our business operations.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge there have been instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any prior written notices of default regarding these late payments. Without such notices, the claim of “repeated default” cannot be procedurally supported and is thus invalid.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpts:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(f)</strong>: <em>"If Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other charge... and if any such default shall be repeated twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, then... upon prior written notice to Tenant, Landlord may terminate this Lease forthwith..."</em></ul></li>

While <strong>Section 23</strong> of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, DBG Properties' consistent acceptance of late rent payments for <strong>40 out of the past 45 months</strong> without objection reasonably implies a <strong>de facto waiver</strong> of strict enforcement. This pattern of behavior suggests that an understanding was established between the parties regarding the flexible enforcement of payment deadlines. However, the primary issue remains that the required written notices for these defaults were never provided, making any claim of default unsupported.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 23</strong>: <em>"No waiver of any condition or covenant of this Lease shall be implied or construed by the failure of Landlord to declare a default for any violation or breach of such condition..."</em></ul></li>

DBG Properties has also been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since the start of our lease in <strong>September 2020</strong>, and these variations were communicated regularly. Rent was consistently accepted under these circumstances until now. The abrupt shift in enforcement raises concerns about the motivation behind this sudden termination.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

I made good-faith efforts to meet our rent obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, on <strong>September 25</strong>, I received a <strong>Pay or Quit</strong> notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. I attempted to pay before the deadline, but I was informed that Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay the October rent before the 5th of the month as required by our lease. However, your office was closed at the time. On <strong>October 7</strong>, my manager brought <strong>$8,000 in cash</strong> to cover both September and October rent, but this payment was refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals directly prevented me from curing the alleged defaults. It appears that these actions were intended to enforce a default, rather than adhere to legitimate enforcement of the lease terms.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your October 8 notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This assertion is factually incorrect. Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, and both operate under the same business and alcohol licenses, as permitted under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease.

West Virginia Code §60-7-2 defines a restaurant as an establishment where at least <strong>60%</strong> of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales being secondary. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11%</strong> of our revenue is derived from food sales, with $433,910.57 in food sales compared to $185,023.24 in alcohol sales. These figures clearly qualify us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar, as your notice suggests. I have attached documentation verifying these sales figures.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their meals before departing. This is a common industry practice and does not constitute a violation of the lease or operating standards.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpts:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(a)</strong>: <em>"Tenant covenants and agrees to use the Premises solely for the operation of a restaurant and may serve alcoholic beverages in conjunction with its food service operations, provided that the sale of food constitutes the primary source of revenue..."</em></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(b)</strong>: <em>"Tenant covenants and agrees (i) never to operate the Premises as a bar or sell alcohol on or from the Premises except as expressly allowed in this paragraph..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed due to an oversight. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and promptly notified Erie Insurance. While Erie updated two of our policies with the new payment information, unfortunately, the third policy was not updated due to an administrative error on their end. Once this issue was brought to our attention, we took immediate steps to rectify the situation. We expect the new policy to be in effect no later than tomorrow.

It’s important to note that under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease, I am entitled to <strong>30 days</strong> to cure a non-rent-related breach, such as an insurance lapse. Since no formal written notice of this breach was provided, citing it as grounds for immediate termination is improper.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>: <em>"If Tenant shall fail to maintain insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such failure and Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure such failure..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>5. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

I have been made aware through multiple sources that an employee of DBG Properties has been spreading information around Huntington that we are facing eviction, without regard to the actual facts or context of this situation. This communication is already affecting our ability to hire new staff, and the uncertainty has negatively impacted sales. These actions represent an interference with our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease, which guarantees our peaceful enjoyment of the premises as long as rent and other obligations are met.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 27</strong>: <em>"Landlord covenants that, upon Tenant paying the rent and performing the covenants herein required of Tenant, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Premises for the term of this Lease..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>6. Trade Fixtures and Property</h3>

With regard to the removal of trade fixtures and other items from the premises, it is important to clarify that under general commercial lease principles, <strong>trade fixtures</strong> are defined as those items that are installed for business operations and are removable without causing significant damage to the premises. This includes our custom bar, furniture, and essential business equipment.

We intend to remove all of our trade fixtures in accordance with the lease upon vacating the premises. In the event that we no longer have the originals for certain fixtures (e.g., lighting), we will replace them with items that are comparable to what was originally present. For example, The Cellar Door was an empty basement prior to our remodel, which ARI paid for, so we will replace high-end fixtures like chandeliers with comparable items that meet the lease’s standards without causing damage.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 11(e)</strong>: <em>"Upon the termination or expiration of this Lease, all improvements, Tenant Alterations, and additions placed on the Premises or affixed thereto by Tenant (other than Tenant's signage, trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment) shall become the property of Landlord without any obligation of further payment on the part of Landlord..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>7. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural and factual violations outlined above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing</ul></li></div>
                        </div>
                    
                        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4 shadow-sm">
                            <div class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Assistant</div>
                            <div class="message-text"> us from curing any alleged defaults.
<ul>- Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of Section 7(a) of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by Section 24(a)(ii).</ul></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This date aligns with our financial commitments and allows for a smooth transition, including avoiding the burden of paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I am committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<h3>5. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

I have been made aware through multiple sources that an employee of DBG Properties has been spreading information around Huntington that we are facing eviction, without regard to the actual facts or context of this situation. This communication is already affecting our ability to hire new staff, and the uncertainty has negatively impacted sales. These actions represent an interference with our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease, which guarantees our peaceful enjoyment of the premises as long as rent and other obligations are met.

<h3>6. Trade Fixtures and Property</h3>

With regard to the removal of trade fixtures and other items from the premises, it is important to clarify that under general commercial lease principles, <strong>trade fixtures</strong> are defined as those items that are installed for business operations and are removable without causing significant damage to the premises. This includes our custom bar, furniture, and essential business equipment.

We intend to remove all of our trade fixtures in accordance with the lease upon vacating the premises. In the event that we no longer have the originals for certain fixtures (e.g., lighting), we will replace them with items that are comparable to what was originally present. For example, The Cellar Door was an empty basement prior to our remodel, which ARI paid for, so we will replace high-end fixtures like chandeliers with comparable items that</div>

<h3>7. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural and factual violations outlined above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing us from curing any alleged defaults.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of Section 7(a) of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by Section 24(a)(ii).</ul></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This date aligns with our financial commitments and allows for a smooth transition, including avoiding the burden of paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I am committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>Date:</strong> October 16, 2024  
<strong>To:</strong> Matt Stickler  
DBG Properties LLC  
911 3rd Avenue, Suite 210  
Huntington, WV 25701

<strong>From:</strong> Christopher Craven  
President, Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your <strong>Notice of Lease Termination</strong> dated October 8, 2024, which I received via certified mail. While I acknowledge that this notice complies with the lease’s requirements for certified delivery, I must point out several procedural and factual issues that need addressing. I also wish to raise concerns regarding the impact of external communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively affecting our business operations.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge there have been instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any prior written notices of default regarding these late payments. Without such notices, the claim of “repeated default” cannot be procedurally supported and is thus invalid.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpts:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(f)</strong>: <em>"If Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other charge... and if any such default shall be repeated twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, then... upon prior written notice to Tenant, Landlord may terminate this Lease forthwith..."</em></ul></li>

While <strong>Section 23</strong> of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, DBG Properties' consistent acceptance of late rent payments for <strong>40 out of the past 45 months</strong> without objection reasonably implies a <strong>de facto waiver</strong> of strict enforcement. This pattern of behavior suggests that an understanding was established between the parties regarding the flexible enforcement of payment deadlines. However, the primary issue remains that the required written notices for these defaults were never provided, making any claim of default unsupported.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 23</strong>: <em>"No waiver of any condition or covenant of this Lease shall be implied or construed by the failure of Landlord to declare a default for any violation or breach of such condition..."</em></ul></li>

DBG Properties has also been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since the start of our lease in <strong>September 2020</strong>, and these variations were communicated regularly. Rent was consistently accepted under these circumstances until now. The abrupt shift in enforcement raises concerns about the motivation behind this sudden termination.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

I made good-faith efforts to meet our rent obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, on <strong>September 25</strong>, I received a <strong>Pay or Quit</strong> notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. Not only did this demand not allow for five business days to pass, as September 28 and 29 fell on a Saturday and Sunday, but I also attempted to pay before the deadline. I was informed that Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided. Additionally, the payment attempt was made before 5 PM, the generally accepted end of the business day.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay the October rent on <strong>Friday, October 4</strong>, but no one was available to accept rent after 3:30 PM. The rent for both September and October was available to be paid at that time. On <strong>October 7</strong>, my manager brought <strong>$8,000 in cash</strong> to cover both months, but this payment was refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals directly prevented me from curing the alleged defaults. It appears that these actions were intended to enforce a default, rather than adhere to legitimate enforcement of the lease terms.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your October 8 notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This assertion is factually incorrect. Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, and both operate under the same business and alcohol licenses, as permitted under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease.

West Virginia Code §60-7-2 defines a restaurant as an establishment where at least <strong>60%</strong> of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales being secondary. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11%</strong> of our revenue is derived from food sales, with $433,910.57 in food sales compared to $185,023.24 in alcohol sales. These figures clearly qualify us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar, as your notice suggests. I have attached documentation verifying these sales figures.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their <strong>experience</strong> before departing. This is a common industry practice and does not constitute a violation of the lease or operating standards.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpts:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(a)</strong>: <em>"Tenant covenants and agrees to use the Premises solely for the operation of a restaurant and may serve alcoholic beverages in conjunction with its food service operations, provided that the sale of food constitutes the primary source of revenue..."</em></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(b)</strong>: <em>"Tenant covenants and agrees (i) never to operate the Premises as a bar or sell alcohol on or from the Premises except as expressly allowed in this paragraph..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed due to an oversight. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and promptly notified Erie Insurance. While Erie updated two of our policies with the new payment information, unfortunately, the third policy was not updated due to an administrative error on their end. Once this issue was brought to our attention, we took immediate steps to rectify the situation. We expect the new policy to be in effect no later than tomorrow.

It’s important to note that under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease, I am entitled to <strong>30 days</strong> to cure a non-rent-related breach, such as an insurance lapse. Since no formal written notice of this breach was provided, citing it as grounds for immediate termination is improper.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>: <em>"If Tenant shall fail to maintain insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such failure and Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure such failure..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>5. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

I have been made aware through multiple sources that an employee of DBG Properties has been spreading information around Huntington that we are facing eviction, without regard to the actual facts or context of this situation. This communication is already affecting our ability to hire new staff, and the uncertainty has negatively impacted sales. These actions represent an interference with our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease, which guarantees our peaceful enjoyment of the premises as long as rent and other obligations are met.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 27</strong>: <em>"Landlord covenants that, upon Tenant paying the rent and performing the covenants herein required of Tenant, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Premises for the term of this Lease..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>6. Trade Fixtures and Property</h3>

With regard to the removal of trade fixtures and other items from the premises, it is important to clarify that under general commercial lease principles, <strong>trade fixtures</strong> are defined as those items that are installed for business operations and are removable without causing significant damage to the premises. This includes our custom bar, furniture, and essential business equipment.

We intend to remove all of our trade fixtures in accordance with the lease upon vacating the premises. In the event that we no longer have the originals for certain fixtures (e.g., lighting), we will replace them with items that are comparable to what was originally present. For example, The Cellar Door was an empty basement prior to our remodel, which ARI paid for, so we will replace high-end fixtures like chandeliers with comparable items that meet the lease’s standards without causing damage. The chandeliers, which are in addition to numerous ceiling lights, are purely decorative in nature and not required for the functionality of the space. The same applies to the chandeliers in Le Bistro.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>

<h3>7. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural and factual violations outlined above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing us from curing any alleged defaults.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of Section 7(a) of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by Section 24(a)(ii).</ul></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This date aligns with our financial commitments and allows for a smooth transition, including avoiding the burden of paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I am committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice.

<h3><strong>Section 6: Trade Fixtures and Property</strong></h3>

We intend to remove all of our trade fixtures in accordance with the lease upon vacating the premises. In the event that we no longer have the originals for certain fixtures (e.g., lighting), we will replace them with items that are comparable to what was originally present. For example, The Cellar Door was an empty basement prior to our remodel, which ARI paid for, so we will replace high-end fixtures like chandeliers with comparable items that meet the lease’s standards without causing damage. 

It’s important to clarify that the <strong>chandeliers</strong> in both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are <strong>ours</strong> and are not necessary for the functionality of the space. The existing ceiling lights are more than sufficient to maintain the operational functionality of the space. The chandeliers are considered <strong>trade fixtures</strong>, as they were installed to meet the specific needs of our business, which serves a niche portion of the market. Their removal will not affect the practical use of the premises.

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your <strong>Notice of Lease Termination</strong> dated October 8, 2024, which I received via certified mail. While I acknowledge that this notice complies with the lease’s requirements for certified delivery, I must point out several procedural and factual issues that need addressing. I also wish to raise concerns regarding the impact of external communications from DBG Properties staff that are negatively affecting our business operations.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge there have been instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease requires that DBG Properties provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any prior written notices of default regarding these late payments. Without such notices, the claim of “repeated default” cannot be procedurally supported and is thus invalid.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpts:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"In the event of default by Tenant under the terms and provisions of this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such default and Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(f)</strong>: <em>"If Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other charge... and if any such default shall be repeated twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, then... upon prior written notice to Tenant, Landlord may terminate this Lease forthwith..."</em></ul></li>

While <strong>Section 23</strong> of the lease includes a clause stating that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future, DBG Properties' consistent acceptance of late rent payments for <strong>40 out of the past 45 months</strong> without objection reasonably implies a <strong>de facto waiver</strong> of strict enforcement. This pattern of behavior suggests that an understanding was established between the parties regarding the flexible enforcement of payment deadlines. However, the primary issue remains that the required written notices for these defaults were never provided, making any claim of default unsupported.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 23</strong>: <em>"No waiver of any condition or covenant of this Lease shall be implied or construed by the failure of Landlord to declare a default for any violation or breach of such condition..."</em></ul></li>

DBG Properties has also been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since the start of our lease in <strong>September 2020</strong>, and these variations were communicated regularly. Rent was consistently accepted under these circumstances until now. The abrupt shift in enforcement raises concerns about the motivation behind this sudden termination.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

I made good-faith efforts to meet our rent obligations, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text that the late fee for September would be waived. Nevertheless, on <strong>September 25</strong>, I received a <strong>Pay or Quit</strong> notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. Not only did this demand not allow for five business days to pass, as September 28 and 29 fell on a Saturday and Sunday, but I also attempted to pay before the deadline. I was informed that Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment, and no alternative method was provided. Additionally, the payment attempt was made before 5 PM, the generally accepted end of the business day.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay the October rent on <strong>Friday, October 4</strong>, but no one was available to accept rent after 3:30 PM. The rent for both September and October was available to be paid at that time. On <strong>October 7</strong>, my manager brought <strong>$8,000 in cash</strong> to cover both months, but this payment was refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals directly prevented me from curing the alleged defaults. It appears that these actions were intended to enforce a default, rather than adhere to legitimate enforcement of the lease terms.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: <em>"Tenant shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure the default..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your October 8 notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This assertion is factually incorrect. Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are distinct areas of the same business, and both operate under the same business and alcohol licenses, as permitted under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease.

West Virginia Code §60-7-2 defines a restaurant as an establishment where at least <strong>60%</strong> of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales being secondary. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11%</strong> of our revenue is derived from food sales, with $433,910.57 in food sales compared to $185,023.24 in alcohol sales. These figures clearly qualify us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar, as your notice suggests. I have attached documentation verifying these sales figures.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow guests already on the premises to finish their <strong>experience</strong> before departing. This is a common industry practice and does not constitute a violation of the lease or operating standards.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpts:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(a)</strong>: <em>"Tenant covenants and agrees to use the Premises solely for the operation of a restaurant and may serve alcoholic beverages in conjunction with its food service operations, provided that the sale of food constitutes the primary source of revenue..."</em></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(b)</strong>: <em>"Tenant covenants and agrees (i) never to operate the Premises as a bar or sell alcohol on or from the Premises except as expressly allowed in this paragraph..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

Regarding the insurance lapse, I acknowledge that one of our required policies briefly lapsed due to an oversight. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and promptly notified Erie Insurance. While Erie updated two of our policies with the new payment information, unfortunately, the third policy was not updated due to an administrative error on their end. Once this issue was brought to our attention, we took immediate steps to rectify the situation. We expect the new policy to be in effect no later than tomorrow.

It’s important to note that under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease, I am entitled to <strong>30 days</strong> to cure a non-rent-related breach, such as an insurance lapse. Since no formal written notice of this breach was provided, citing it as grounds for immediate termination is improper.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>: <em>"If Tenant shall fail to maintain insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease, Landlord agrees to notify Tenant in writing of such failure and Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such written notice in which to cure such failure..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>5. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

I have been made aware through multiple sources that an employee of DBG Properties has been spreading information around Huntington that we are facing eviction, without regard to the actual facts or context of this situation. This communication is already affecting our ability to hire new staff, and the uncertainty has negatively impacted sales. These actions represent an interference with our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease, which guarantees our peaceful enjoyment of the premises as long as rent and other obligations are met.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 27</strong>: <em>"Landlord covenants that, upon Tenant paying the rent and performing the covenants herein required of Tenant, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Premises for the term of this Lease..."</em></ul></li>

<h3>6. Trade Fixtures and Property</h3>

We intend to remove all of our trade fixtures in accordance with the lease upon vacating the premises. In the event that we no longer have the originals for certain fixtures (e.g., lighting), we will replace them with items that are comparable to what was originally present. For example, The Cellar Door was an empty basement prior to our remodel, which ARI paid for, so we will replace high-end fixtures like chandeliers with comparable items that meet the lease’s standards without causing damage. 

It’s important to clarify that the <strong>chandeliers</strong> in both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are <strong>ours</strong> and are not necessary for the functionality of the space. The existing ceiling lights are more than sufficient to maintain the operational functionality of the space. The chandeliers are considered <strong>trade fixtures</strong>, as they were installed to meet the specific needs of our business, which serves a niche portion of the market. Their removal will not affect the practical use of the premises.

<strong>Relevant Lease Excerpt:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 11(e)</strong>: *"Upon the termination or expiration of this Lease, all improvements, Tenant Alterations, and additions placed on the Premises or affixed thereto by Tenant (other than Tenant's signage, trade fixtures, merchandise</ul></li></div>
                        </div>

                            <div class="message-text">, and equipment) shall become the property of Landlord without any obligation of further payment on the part of Landlord..."*

<h3>7. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural and factual violations outlined above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by Sections 24(a)(i) and 36 of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing us from curing any alleged defaults.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Operational compliance is fully within the bounds of Section 7(a) of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by Section 24(a)(ii).</ul></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This date aligns with our financial commitments and allows for a smooth transition, including avoiding the burden of paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I am committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope we can resolve these issues in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations
Dear Mr. Stickler,
I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally respond to the Notice of Lease Termination we received on October 1, 2024. After careful review, we believe there are several procedural violations that need to be addressed.
First and foremost, the notice did not comply with the 90-day termination requirement as outlined in our lease agreement dated January 15, 2015. According to Section 14.2, a minimum of 90 days' notice is mandatory for any termination not resulting from a breach of lease terms. The notice provided only 45 days, which we consider insufficient and a direct violation of our agreement.
Additionally, the grounds for termination cited in your notice appear to lack substantiated documentation. Specifically, the claims regarding consistent late payments and property damage were surprising, as our records indicate timely payments and adherence to property maintenance standards. We respectfully request detailed evidence supporting these allegations within 10 business days to further understand and address the concerns raised.
Furthermore, we have not been provided with any opportunity to remedy the purported issues, which is a right explicitly granted under Section 12.1 of our lease agreement. We are fully committed to resolving any legitimate concerns and believe it is in the best interest of both parties to pursue an amicable resolution.
In light of these points, we kindly request the immediate withdrawal of the termination notice. We also propose a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter in detail and explore alternative solutions that would benefit both parties.
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. We look forward to your prompt response.
Yours sincerely,

It is no where near as detailed as ours, nor does it use accurate information like ours, but the tone of the letter i kind of like. Is it possible for you to ensure that not even a character of the depth of explanation we have given above is lost, but for you to provide our response in a tone more close to copilots?</div>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Concerns

Dear Mr. Stickler,

I hope this letter finds you well. I’m writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination that was delivered to us on October 8, 2024. After reviewing your notice and the claims within, I believe there are several procedural and factual matters that need to be addressed before moving forward.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I recognize that there have been some instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease specifies that DBG Properties must provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any prior written notices of default related to these late payments, and without such notices, the claim of “repeated default” is unsupported.

Additionally, I’d like to point out that <strong>Section 23</strong> of the lease includes a clause stating that accepting late rent does not waive the right to enforce payment deadlines in the future. However, rent payments have been accepted without objection for <strong>40 out of the past 45 months</strong>. This implies a pattern of behavior that reasonably led us to believe that strict enforcement of deadlines wasn’t being prioritized. While I understand that the non-waiver clause exists, the fact that written notices were not provided remains the more relevant issue here.

Moreover, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since the beginning of our lease in <strong>September 2020</strong>, and we have communicated regularly about this. Rent has been consistently accepted under these conditions, which raises concerns about why enforcement is suddenly being emphasized now.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

Regarding the rent payments for September and October, I made several good-faith efforts to resolve the situation, but was ultimately prevented from doing so. 
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text that the late fee for September would be waived. However, on <strong>September 25</strong>, I received a <strong>Pay or Quit</strong> notice demanding $4,600 (including late fees) by September 30. This didn’t provide enough time for five full business days to pass, as September 28 and 29 fell on a weekend. Despite this, I made efforts to pay before the deadline, but I was informed that Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment. No alternative method was provided, and I attempted to pay before 5 PM, which is the generally accepted close of the business day.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: Similarly, I attempted to pay the October rent on <strong>Friday, October 4</strong>, but no one was available to accept the payment after 3:30 PM. Both September and October rent payments were available to give to DBG at that time. On <strong>October 7</strong>, my manager brought <strong>$8,000 in cash</strong> to cover both months, but again, the payment was refused without explanation.</ul></li>

I am concerned that these refusals prevented us from curing the alleged defaults, suggesting that DBG Properties may be attempting to enforce a default without giving us a legitimate opportunity to resolve it.

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This is incorrect. Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are two distinct areas of the same business, both operating under the same licenses, and both in compliance with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease.

West Virginia Code §60-7-2 defines a restaurant as an establishment where at least <strong>60%</strong> of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales being secondary. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11%</strong> of our total revenue comes from food sales, which clearly qualifies us as a restaurant under state law, not a bar. We’ve attached documentation that verifies these figures for your review.

Furthermore, while we stop seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow customers already present to finish their <strong>experience</strong> before leaving. This is a common practice and does not violate the terms of the lease or industry standards.

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

I acknowledge that one of our insurance policies briefly lapsed due to an oversight. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and promptly notified our insurance provider, Erie Insurance. While two of our policies were updated with the new payment information, unfortunately, the third policy was not. Once the lapse was brought to our attention, we took immediate steps to rectify the situation, and we expect the new policy to be in effect by tomorrow.

It’s worth noting that under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease, we are entitled to <strong>30 days</strong> to cure a non-rent-related breach like this insurance lapse. Since no formal written notice of this breach was provided, citing it as a reason for termination is improper.

<h3>5. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

I have been made aware, through multiple sources, that an employee of DBG Properties has been sharing information around Huntington about our potential eviction, without context or factual basis. This has negatively impacted our ability to hire new staff and has had a detrimental effect on our sales. These actions constitute a breach of our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease, which guarantees our peaceful enjoyment of the premises as long as we meet our obligations.

<h3>6. Trade Fixtures and Property</h3>

Finally, regarding the removal of trade fixtures and other property upon vacating, I want to emphasize that all <strong>chandeliers</strong> in both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are <strong>ours</strong> and will be removed. The existing ceiling lights are more than sufficient to maintain the functionality of the space, so the removal of the chandeliers will not affect operations. These chandeliers are considered <strong>trade fixtures</strong> as they were installed specifically for the needs of our niche market. We will also replace any items, such as lighting, where we no longer have the original fixtures, with comparable items that meet the lease's standards.

<h3>7. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of the procedural violations and factual inaccuracies detailed above, I kindly request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused, preventing us from curing any alleged defaults.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Our operations comply fully with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</ul></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This date allows for a smooth transition, aligns with our financial commitments, and avoids paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

We are committed to meeting all obligations under the lease and resolving this matter in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you need any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

There are a couple of additional facts I would like to include in regards to the employee of DBG that has been sharing information, including that he has been entered the restaurants on multiple occasions very early in the morning (various times between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM, without reason or notice and seemingly under the influence of alcohol. Also, after the previous owner asked me to help with some bookkeeping / profitability issues they were experiencing, I was made  aware that Paula Vega Cupcakes (local bakery that has a a prep kitchen next to the Cellar Door’s kitchen) does not have a water meter separate from ours. I would like that issue resolved. Additionally, you have been asked a multitude of times over the past two years to change our back door code, as we have had turnover rates consistent with the industry, meaning it is a serious breach in security. in the past 12 months alone we have had 65+ employees that have left or have come and gone… all of whom know the door code.

This will maintain the professional tone of the letter while ensuring that all relevant lease details are included for reference without cluttering the main body of the letter. It’s a common and acceptable practice to reference these points in an appendix or addendum.

As for the additional facts you’ve provided, I would recommend briefly mentioning them in the body of the letter, especially as they relate to security concerns and the employee’s conduct, which strengthens your case regarding breaches of your right to quiet enjoyment and raises valid concerns about the professionalism of DBG's management. These points could be tied to the issue of security and operational stability, showing that these are ongoing problems that DBG Properties has not addressed.

Regarding your second request, here’s a list of recommended supporting documentation to include with the letter:

Specifically, the ADA requires public accommodations, such as restaurants, to remove barriers that impede access to their facilities, provided it is "readily achievable" to do so. This means that if there is an entrance that requires stairs, there must be an alternative route (such as a ramp or elevator) to ensure accessibility.

In the case of <strong>basement-level restaurants</strong>, there are specific ADA guidelines that apply. If the restaurant is open to the public, the only accessible entrance being an elevator would need to be functional during the restaurant's operating hours. The fact that the elevator doors are not operating consistently and only during certain hours may put DBG Properties in violation of ADA compliance, especially if this is the only wheelchair-accessible entry.

Including this information in your letter strengthens your case, particularly concerning the accessibility and security issues. This could add more weight to your argument about their failure to properly maintain the property, further affecting your business operations.

Would you like me to incorporate this accessibility concern and the legal requirement into the draft, and would you like to provide any documentation of your previous requests for elevator door repairs?</div>

Here’s how we can address this in the letter:

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Wheelchair Accessibility and Security Concerns</strong></h3>

We have repeatedly requested that DBG Properties fix the <strong>double doors</strong> between Le Bistro and The Cellar Door’s entrances, which lead to the hallway accessing the elevator that provides the <strong>only wheelchair-accessible entry</strong> to The Cellar Door. Currently, the doors are functioning irregularly, opening only during lunch hours Monday through Friday. This creates significant security concerns as the restaurant is closed during the day, yet access to the space is still available.

This situation also raises concerns regarding <strong>ADA compliance</strong>, as the elevator is the only means for individuals with disabilities to access The Cellar Door. The ADA requires that businesses provide accessible entry for all customers during operating hours. Therefore, DBG Properties’ failure to maintain these doors not only affects security but also may violate federal accessibility requirements.

Since the <strong>double doors</strong> are the only access to the elevator, which is the only <strong>wheelchair-accessible entry</strong>, failing to maintain them during the restaurant’s operating hours could potentially violate the ADA if it impedes customers' ability to access the space.

Whether it definitively violates ADA compliance would depend on factors like:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Consistency in access</strong>: If the only wheelchair-accessible entry is not functioning during business hours, it could be seen as non-compliant.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Reasonableness</strong>: Whether keeping the doors operational falls within what the ADA considers "readily achievable."</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Customer Impact</strong>: If wheelchair users cannot access the establishment during hours of operation, that would likely be considered a violation.</ul></li>

Given that the double doors have a <strong>remote security system</strong> in place, which can adjust access levels and door codes, maintaining regular access to this entryway should be a minimal-effort task. This strengthens the argument that ensuring wheelchair access is "readily achievable."

<h3><strong>Wheelchair Accessibility and ADA Violation</strong></h3>

We have repeatedly requested that DBG Properties fix the <strong>double doors</strong> between Le Bistro and The Cellar Door’s entrances, which lead to the hallway accessing the elevator that provides the <strong>only wheelchair-accessible entry</strong> to The Cellar Door. These doors currently operate inconsistently, opening only during limited hours, primarily around lunchtime on weekdays. As a result, during <strong>at least 50% of our operating hours</strong>, individuals requiring wheelchair access are unable to enter The Cellar Door, creating a significant <strong>ADA compliance issue</strong>.

Under the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong>, businesses are required to provide accessible entrances for individuals with disabilities during operating hours. Since the double doors leading to the elevator are the only accessible route for wheelchair users, DBG Properties’ failure to maintain these doors is a direct violation of ADA requirements. 

Furthermore, the double doors have an updated security system that allows for <strong>remote changes</strong> to the door code and access level, a feature that has been in place since at least <strong>May 2017</strong>. Given that maintaining regular access to this entryway can be done with minimal effort, the lack of consistent access is both a compliance and security concern.

DBG Properties LLC

Huntington, WV 25701

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Concerns

Dear Mr. Stickler,

I hope this letter finds you well. I’m writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination delivered to us on October 8, 2024. After reviewing your notice and the claims within, there are several procedural and factual matters that need to be addressed.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge there have been some instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease specifies that DBG Properties must provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any prior written notices of default, and without such notices, the claim of “repeated default” is unsupported.

Additionally, <strong>Section 23</strong> of the lease states that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines. However, rent payments have been accepted without objection for <strong>40 out of the past 45 months</strong>, which implies a pattern that reasonably led us to believe that strict enforcement of deadlines wasn’t being prioritized. While I understand the non-waiver clause, the fact that required written notices were not provided is the primary issue.

Moreover, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since the start of our lease in <strong>September 2020</strong>, and rent has consistently been accepted during these fluctuations. This abrupt shift in enforcement raises concerns about other possible motivations behind this termination.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

Regarding the rent payments for September and October, I made good-faith efforts to resolve the situation, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text that the late fee for September would be waived. However, on <strong>September 25</strong>, I received a <strong>Pay or Quit</strong> notice demanding $4,600 by September 30. Not only did this demand fail to provide five business days, but I also attempted to pay before the deadline and was informed that Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment. No alternative method was provided, and I attempted to pay before 5 PM, the generally accepted end of the business day.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: On <strong>Friday, October 4</strong>, I attempted to pay the rent, but no one was available to accept payment after 3:30 PM. Both September and October rent payments were ready to be paid at that time. On <strong>October 7</strong>, my manager brought <strong>$8,000 in cash</strong> to cover both months, but payment was again refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals prevented us from curing the alleged defaults, indicating an intent to enforce a default without providing a legitimate opportunity to resolve it.

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This is factually incorrect. Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door operate under the same business and alcohol licenses, as permitted under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease.

West Virginia Code §60-7-2 defines a restaurant as an establishment where at least <strong>60%</strong> of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales secondary. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11%</strong> of our total revenue comes from food sales. These figures clearly show that we qualify as a restaurant under state law, not a bar. Attached to this letter is documentation verifying these sales figures.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow customers already present to finish their <strong>experience</strong> before leaving. This is a common practice and does not violate the terms of the lease or industry standards.

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

I acknowledge that one of our insurance policies briefly lapsed due to an oversight. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and promptly notified Erie Insurance. While two of our policies were updated with the new payment information, the third policy was not. We took immediate steps to rectify this once we were made aware, and the policy should be reinstated shortly.

Under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease, we are entitled to <strong>30 days</strong> to cure a non-rent-related breach such as this insurance lapse. Since no formal notice of this breach was provided, citing it as a reason for termination is improper.

<h3>5. Wheelchair Accessibility and ADA Violation</h3>

We have repeatedly requested that DBG Properties fix the <strong>double doors</strong> between Le Bistro and The Cellar Door’s entrances, which lead to the hallway accessing the elevator that provides the <strong>only wheelchair-accessible entry</strong> to The Cellar Door. These doors currently operate inconsistently, opening only during limited hours, primarily around lunchtime on weekdays. As a result, during <strong>at least 50% of our operating hours</strong>, individuals requiring wheelchair access are unable to enter The Cellar Door, which creates a significant <strong>ADA compliance issue</strong>.

Under the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong>, businesses are required to provide accessible entrances for individuals with disabilities during operating hours. The failure to maintain this accessible entry violates federal accessibility requirements, especially given that the double doors have a <strong>remote security system</strong> that allows for <strong>minimal effort</strong> to adjust access, such as changing the door code or access level, a feature that has been in place since <strong>May 2017</strong>.

<h3>6. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

Additionally, I’ve been made aware that a DBG Properties employee has been entering The Cellar Door between <strong>3:00 AM and 5:00 AM</strong> without reason or notice, and seemingly under the influence of alcohol. This same employee has also been spreading misinformation around Huntington about our alleged eviction. These actions negatively impact our ability to hire new staff and harm our business reputation. This breach of our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease cannot be overlooked.

<h3>7. Trade Fixtures and Property</h3>

We intend to remove all of our <strong>trade fixtures</strong> in accordance with the lease upon vacating the premises. Should we no longer have the originals for certain fixtures, we will replace them with items comparable to what was originally present. For example, The Cellar Door was an empty basement before our remodel, which ARI paid for, so we will replace high-end fixtures like chandeliers with comparable items that meet lease standards without causing damage. 

The <strong>chandeliers</strong> in both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are <strong>ours</strong>, and the ceiling lights are sufficient to maintain the functionality of the space. The chandeliers are considered <strong>trade fixtures</strong>, as they were installed to meet the specific needs of our niche market.

<h3>8. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of these issues, I kindly request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Our operations comply fully with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The wheelchair-accessible entry is not maintained, which is an ADA violation.</ul></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This timeline allows for a smooth transition and avoids paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

We are committed to meeting all obligations under the lease and resolving this matter in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Here’s how we can revise the language to reflect this:

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Trade Fixtures and Property</strong></h3>

We intend to remove all of our <strong>trade fixtures</strong> in accordance with the lease upon vacating the premises. As the <strong>recessed lighting</strong> at The Cellar Door is more than sufficient to maintain the functionality of the space, the <strong>chandeliers</strong> were installed purely for decorative purposes to enhance the relaxed, lounge-like atmosphere that is a core part of our business's unique selling proposition (USP). These chandeliers are therefore <strong>trade fixtures</strong>, installed to serve a specific purpose for our business rather than being necessary for the basic operation of the space.

Given this, we do not believe it is necessary to replace the chandeliers, as their removal will not affect the functionality of the space. However, if required, we are prepared to replace any other fixtures for which we no longer have the originals with items comparable to what was present before.

Generally, under commercial lease law, trade fixtures that a tenant installs to conduct their business are allowed to be removed upon vacating, as long as their removal does not cause damage to the property or alter its fundamental structure. Since these items were clearly installed to serve the needs of your restaurants (and are not part of the original property), they should be classified as trade fixtures. The chandeliers, the custom bar, and shelving would likely fall under this category.

I recommend that you assert the following points in the letter:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Trade Fixtures</strong>: Clearly state that the <strong>chandeliers</strong>, <strong>custom bar</strong>, <strong>back bar shelving</strong>, <strong>tables</strong>, <strong>chairs</strong>, <strong>kitchen equipment</strong>, etc., are all <strong>trade fixtures</strong> that were installed to serve your business operations. These are not part of the original structure or property provided by the landlord.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Removal Process</strong>: Emphasize that you will remove these fixtures in a manner that does not cause damage to the premises. If any minor damage occurs during the removal (e.g., from mounting screws or small holes), you can state that these will be repaired.</ol></li>

Here’s an adjusted section for the letter:

As the <strong>recessed lighting</strong> in The Cellar Door is sufficient for the functionality of the space, and the <strong>chandeliers</strong> were installed purely for ambiance, their removal will not impact the basic operation of the premises.

<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Outsourcing for a specialized opinion</strong>: At the moment, I don’t have the ability to directly outsource to a separate GPT for legal advice or verification. However, I can further refine the draft by strengthening the argument, focusing on precedent and typical interpretations of trade fixtures in commercial leases. </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Legal Definition of Trade Fixtures</strong>: Yes, there is a well-established legal definition of <strong>trade fixtures</strong> under both federal and state law. <strong>Trade fixtures</strong> are generally considered items that a tenant installs for the purpose of conducting their business, and they remain the tenant's property, which can be removed upon vacating the premises. In most cases, unless the lease explicitly states otherwise, a tenant is allowed to remove these fixtures as long as they do not cause substantial damage to the property.</ol></li>

Here’s a <strong>stronger definition</strong> for the letter based on common legal principles:

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Trade Fixtures and Property</strong></h3>

Under established legal precedent, <strong>trade fixtures</strong> are defined as fixtures that are installed by a tenant for the specific purpose of conducting their business. These remain the property of the tenant, and tenants have the right to remove them at the conclusion of the lease, provided that no significant damage is done to the premises. This principle is recognized in both federal and state law.

In accordance with these principles, we intend to remove all of our <strong>trade fixtures</strong> upon vacating the premises. This includes:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>8 chandeliers</strong> in the event room,</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>6 pendant Turkish glass lights</strong> over The Cellar Door's bar,</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A <strong>large black chandelier</strong> in The Cellar Door's reception area,</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>3 pendant lights</strong> over Bistro’s bar,</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A <strong>large chandelier</strong> over Bistro’s host stand area,</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>2 chandeliers</strong> in the windows of Le Bistro.</ul></li>

Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door’s dining rooms have sufficient lighting sources, including <strong>recessed lights</strong>, <strong>dome lights</strong>, and <strong>spotlights</strong>, which are more than capable of maintaining the functionality of the space. The chandeliers were installed to enhance the ambiance and are purely decorative, meaning their removal will not impact the functionality of the premises.

Additionally, we will also remove other <strong>trade fixtures</strong>, including the <strong>custom bar</strong>, <strong>back bar shelving</strong>, <strong>kitchen equipment</strong>, <strong>tables</strong>, <strong>chairs</strong>, <strong>caterware</strong>, <strong>wall ornaments</strong>, <strong>Bistro’s bar cabinetry</strong>, and the <strong>host stand</strong>. These items were installed solely to facilitate our business operations, and under established law, they are not part of the property provided by the landlord. We will ensure their removal is done without causing significant damage, and any minor repairs, such as for mounting holes, will be addressed.

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>6. Trade Fixtures and Property Removal</strong>

We fully intend to remove all of our trade fixtures in accordance with the lease upon vacating the premises. While the lease does not explicitly define "trade fixtures," it is well-established under both federal and state law that trade fixtures are those items that a tenant installs for the purpose of conducting business and are considered the tenant's property. These include, but are not limited to, our custom bars, back bar shelving, specialized lighting fixtures, and the kitchen equipment that is integral to our operations.

It is important to note that the chandeliers, pendant lights, and other custom lighting installed at both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door were added for the purpose of creating a unique ambiance and are not required for the basic functionality of the space. The recessed lighting and other fixed light sources at both locations are more than sufficient to maintain the functionality of the premises after we remove these decorative fixtures. Given the nature of our business, which targets a niche market with a lounge-like atmosphere, these items qualify as trade fixtures and will be removed.

In the event we no longer have the originals for certain fixtures, such as some of the lighting, we will replace them with comparable items that meet the lease's standards and do not cause damage to the property.

<h3><strong>Date:</strong> October 16, 2024  </h3>
<strong>To:</strong> Matt Stickler  
DBG Properties LLC  
911 3rd Avenue, Suite 210  
Huntington, WV 25701  

<strong>From:</strong> Christopher Craven  
President, Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations  

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
Dear Mr. Stickler,

I hope this letter finds you well. I’m writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination delivered to us on October 8, 2024. After reviewing your notice and the claims within, there are several procedural and factual matters that need to be addressed.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge there have been some instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease specifies that DBG Properties must provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any prior written notices of default, and without such notices, the claim of “repeated default” is unsupported.

Additionally, <strong>Section 23</strong> of the lease states that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines. However, rent payments have been accepted without objection for <strong>40 out of the past 45 months</strong>, which implies a pattern that reasonably led us to believe that strict enforcement of deadlines wasn’t being prioritized. While I understand the non-waiver clause, the fact that required written notices were not provided is the primary issue.

Moreover, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since the start of our lease in <strong>September 2020</strong>, and rent has consistently been accepted during these fluctuations. This abrupt shift in enforcement raises concerns about other possible motivations behind this termination.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

Regarding the rent payments for September and October, I made good-faith efforts to resolve the situation, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text that the late fee for September would be waived. However, on <strong>September 25</strong>, I received a <strong>Pay or Quit</strong> notice demanding $4,600 by September 30. Not only did this demand fail to provide five business days (excluding the weekend), but I also attempted to pay before the deadline and was informed that Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment. No alternative method was provided, and I attempted to pay before 5 PM, the generally accepted end of the business day.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: On <strong>Friday, October 4</strong>, I attempted to pay the rent, but no one was available to accept payment after 3:30 PM. Both September and October rent payments were ready to be paid at that time. On <strong>October 7</strong>, my manager brought <strong>$8,000 in cash</strong> to cover both months, but payment was again refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals prevented us from curing the alleged defaults, indicating an intent to enforce a default without providing a legitimate opportunity to resolve it.

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This is factually incorrect. Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door operate under the same business and alcohol licenses, as permitted under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease.

West Virginia Code §60-7-2 defines a restaurant as an establishment where at least <strong>60%</strong> of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales secondary. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11%</strong> of our total revenue comes from food sales. These figures clearly show that we qualify as a restaurant under state law, not a bar. Attached to this letter is documentation verifying these sales figures.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow customers already present to finish their <strong>experience</strong> before leaving. This is a common practice and does not violate the terms of the lease or industry standards.

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

I acknowledge that one of our insurance policies briefly lapsed due to an oversight. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and promptly notified Erie Insurance. While two of our policies were updated with the new payment information, the third policy was not. We took immediate steps to rectify this once we were made aware, and the policy should be reinstated shortly.

Under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease, we are entitled to <strong>30 days</strong> to cure a non-rent-related breach such as this insurance lapse. Since no formal notice of this breach was provided, citing it as a reason for termination is improper.

<h3>5. Wheelchair Accessibility and ADA Violation</h3>

We have repeatedly requested that DBG Properties fix the <strong>double doors</strong> between Le Bistro and The Cellar Door’s entrances, which lead to the hallway accessing the elevator that provides the <strong>only wheelchair-accessible entry</strong> to The Cellar Door. These doors currently operate inconsistently, opening only during limited hours, primarily around lunchtime on weekdays. As a result, during <strong>at least 50% of our operating hours</strong>, individuals requiring wheelchair access are unable to enter The Cellar Door, which creates a significant <strong>ADA compliance issue</strong>.

Under the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong>, businesses are required to provide accessible entrances for individuals with disabilities during operating hours. The failure to maintain this accessible entry violates federal accessibility requirements, especially given that the double doors have a <strong>remote security system</strong> that allows for <strong>minimal effort</strong> to adjust access, such as changing the door code or access level, a feature that has been in place since <strong>May 2017</strong>.

<h3>6. Trade Fixtures and Property Removal</h3>

Under established legal precedent, <strong>trade fixtures</strong> are defined as fixtures that are installed by a tenant for the specific purpose of conducting their business. These remain the property of the tenant, and tenants have the right to remove them at the conclusion of the lease, provided that no significant damage is done to the premises. This principle is recognized in both federal and state law.

In accordance with these principles, we intend to remove all of our <strong>trade fixtures</strong> upon vacating the premises. These fixtures were installed specifically to serve the needs of our business, including, but not limited to, our custom bars, shelving, specialized lighting, and kitchen equipment. Their removal will not impact the basic functionality of the premises, as adequate permanent lighting and infrastructure remain. 

We will ensure that all trade fixtures are removed in a manner that avoids damage to the premises. Any minor repairs, such as for mounting holes, will be addressed.

<h3>7. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

Additionally, I’ve been made aware that a DBG Properties employee has been entering The Cellar Door between <strong>3:00 AM and 5:00 AM</strong> without reason or notice, and seemingly under the influence of alcohol. This same employee has also been spreading misinformation around Huntington about our alleged eviction. These actions negatively impact our ability to hire new staff and harm our business reputation. This breach of our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease cannot be overlooked.

<h3>8. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of these issues, I kindly request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Our operations comply fully with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The wheelchair-accessible entry is not maintained, which is an ADA violation.</ul></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This timeline allows for a smooth transition and avoids paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

We are committed to meeting all obligations under the lease and resolving this matter in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<h3><strong>Date:</strong> October 16, 2024  </h3>
<strong>To:</strong> Matt Stickler  
DBG Properties LLC  
911 3rd Avenue, Suite 210  
Huntington, WV 25701  

<strong>From:</strong> Christopher Craven  
President, Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.  
DBA Le Bistro & The Cellar Door  
905 3rd Avenue  
Huntington, WV 25701  

<strong>Subject:</strong> Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Procedural Violations  

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
Dear Mr. Stickler,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination delivered to us on October 8, 2024. After reviewing your notice and the claims within, several procedural and factual matters need to be addressed.

<h3>1. Claims of “Repeated Default”</h3>

While I acknowledge there have been instances of late rent payments, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of our lease specifies that DBG Properties must provide written notice of each default in accordance with <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> for such defaults to be used as grounds for termination. To date, we have not received any prior written notices of default, and without such notices, the claim of “repeated default” is unsupported.

Additionally, <strong>Section 23</strong> of the lease states that the acceptance of late rent does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce payment deadlines. However, rent payments have been accepted without objection for <strong>40 out of the past 45 months</strong>, which implies a pattern that reasonably led us to believe that strict enforcement of deadlines wasn’t being prioritized. While I understand the non-waiver clause, the fact that required written notices were not provided is the primary issue.

Moreover, DBG Properties has been fully aware of our seasonal cash flow variations since the start of our lease in <strong>September 2020</strong>, and rent has consistently been accepted during these fluctuations. This abrupt shift in enforcement raises concerns about other possible motivations behind this termination.

<h3>2. Attempts to Cure September and October Rent Payments</h3>

Regarding the rent payments for September and October, I made good-faith efforts to resolve the situation, but DBG Properties refused to accept payment:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text that the late fee for September would be waived. However, on <strong>September 25</strong>, I received a <strong>Pay or Quit</strong> notice demanding $4,600 by September 30. Not only did this demand fail to provide five business days (excluding the weekend), but I also attempted to pay before the deadline and was informed that Logan Stickler was not authorized to accept payment. No alternative method was provided, and I attempted to pay before 5 PM, the generally accepted end of the business day.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: On <strong>Friday, October 4</strong>, I attempted to pay the rent, but no one was available to accept payment after 3:30 PM. Both September and October rent payments were ready to be paid at that time. On <strong>October 7</strong>, my manager brought <strong>$8,000 in cash</strong> to cover both months, but payment was again refused without explanation.</ul></li>

These refusals prevented us from curing the alleged defaults, indicating an intent to enforce a default without providing a legitimate opportunity to resolve it.

<h3>3. Allegations of Operational Non-Compliance</h3>

Your notice claims that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door are operating as a bar in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. This is factually incorrect. Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door operate under the same business and alcohol licenses, as permitted under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease.

West Virginia Code §60-7-2 defines a restaurant as an establishment where at least <strong>60%</strong> of revenue is derived from food sales, with alcohol sales secondary. Based on our sales data, <strong>70.11%</strong> of our total revenue comes from food sales. These figures clearly show that we qualify as a restaurant under state law, not a bar. Attached to this letter is documentation verifying these sales figures.

Furthermore, while we cease seating new guests at the designated closing time and turn off the “open” sign, we allow customers already present to finish their <strong>experience</strong> before leaving. This is a common practice and does not violate the terms of the lease or industry standards.

<h3>4. Insurance Lapse and Rectification</h3>

I acknowledge that one of our insurance policies briefly lapsed due to an oversight. After we became victims of fraud, we closed the associated bank account and promptly notified Erie Insurance. While two of our policies were updated with the new payment information, the third policy was not. We took immediate steps to rectify this once we were made aware, and the policy should be reinstated shortly.

Under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease, we are entitled to <strong>30 days</strong> to cure a non-rent-related breach such as this insurance lapse. Since no formal notice of this breach was provided, citing it as a reason for termination is improper.

<h3>5. Wheelchair Accessibility and ADA Violation</h3>

We have repeatedly requested that DBG Properties fix the <strong>double doors</strong> between Le Bistro and The Cellar Door’s entrances, which lead to the hallway accessing the elevator that provides the <strong>only wheelchair-accessible entry</strong> to The Cellar Door. These doors currently operate inconsistently, opening only during limited hours, primarily around lunchtime on weekdays. As a result, during <strong>at least 50% of our operating hours</strong>, individuals requiring wheelchair access are unable to enter The Cellar Door, which creates a significant <strong>ADA compliance issue</strong>.

Under the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong>, businesses are required to provide accessible entrances for individuals with disabilities during operating hours. The failure to maintain this accessible entry violates federal accessibility requirements, especially given that the double doors have a <strong>remote security system</strong> that allows for <strong>minimal effort</strong> to adjust access, such as changing the door code or access level, a feature that has been in place since <strong>May 2017</strong>.

<h3>6. Trade Fixtures and Property Removal</h3>

Per <strong>Section 11(e)</strong> of our lease, trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment that were installed to serve the needs of our business remain our property and will be removed upon vacating the premises. These include, but are not limited to, our custom bars, shelving, specialized lighting, and kitchen equipment.

All removals will be conducted in a manner that avoids significant damage to the premises, and any minor repairs, such as filling mounting holes, will be promptly addressed. Additionally, the removal of decorative items such as chandeliers and pendant lights will not affect the basic functionality of the space, as the premises are adequately equipped with permanent lighting fixtures, including recessed lights, dome lights, and spotlights.

<h3>7. Quiet Enjoyment and Harmful Communications</h3>

Additionally, I’ve been made aware that a DBG Properties employee has been entering The Cellar Door between <strong>3:00 AM and 5:00 AM</strong> without reason or notice, and seemingly under the influence of alcohol. This same employee has also been spreading misinformation around Huntington about our alleged eviction. These actions negatively impact our ability to hire new staff and harm our business reputation. This breach of our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease cannot be overlooked.

<h3>8. Resolution Request</h3>

In light of these issues, I kindly request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. Specifically:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notice was provided for alleged defaults, as required by <strong>Sections 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>36</strong> of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Good-faith rent payments were actively refused.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Our operations comply fully with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease and West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is being resolved, and no formal notice was provided as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The wheelchair-accessible entry is not maintained, which is an ADA violation.</ul></li>

While I remain open to discussing an early termination of the lease, the only viable option is for us to vacate the premises by <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This timeline allows for a smooth transition and avoids paying for two sets of licenses.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

We are committed to meeting all obligations under the lease and resolving this matter in good faith. Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation, including proof of the new insurance policy, I am happy to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<strong>Section 24(a)(ii): Cure Period for Non-Rent Defaults (Insurance Lapse)</strong>  
_“In the event of a non-rent default, including but not limited to failure to maintain required insurance, Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of written notice to cure the default.”_
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Relevance</strong>: There was no formal written notice of the insurance lapse, and we are actively working to cure this issue. Thus, the termination notice cannot cite this lapse as valid grounds for default.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>Section 24(f): Repeated Default</strong>  
_“If any default shall be repeated twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, notwithstanding that such defaults were cured by Tenant, any further similar default within said period shall be deemed a repeated default without cure rights.”_
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Relevance</strong>: No prior defaults were formally noticed within the 12-month period, meaning that the claim of “repeated default” is unsupported.</ul></li>

<strong>Section 7(a): Permitted Use of the Premises</strong>  
_“The premises shall be used and occupied solely for the purpose of operating a restaurant with the sale of alcoholic beverages permitted, provided that the primary source of revenue is from food sales.”_
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Relevance</strong>: Our sales data shows that 70.11% of our revenue comes from food, which is well above the legal threshold. Thus, we are compliant with both lease terms and state law in operating as a restaurant, not a bar.</ul></li>

It has come to my attention that a DBG Properties employee has been entering The Cellar Door during the early hours of the morning, between <strong>3:00 AM and 5:00 AM</strong>, without notice or valid reason, and potentially under the influence of alcohol. This same individual has also been spreading misinformation around Huntington regarding our alleged eviction, which has already had a negative impact on our ability to hire new staff and has caused reputational harm to our business.

While I prefer not to escalate this matter, it is important to note that such actions represent a breach of our right to <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> under <strong>Section 27</strong> of the lease.

                            <div class="message-text">Here’s a comprehensive summary of all the relevant information related to your lease dispute:

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Overview of the Dispute</strong></h3>
<ul>- <strong>Parties Involved</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Tenant</strong>: Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc. (DBA Le Bistro & The Cellar Door)</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Landlord</strong>: DBG Properties LLC, represented by Matt Stickler (Building Manager)</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Premises</strong>: 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, occupied by Le Bistro and The Cellar Door.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Issue</strong>: DBG Properties issued a Notice of Lease Termination, citing alleged rent defaults, operational non-compliance, and an insurance lapse as reasons for termination.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Key Allegations by DBG Properties</strong></h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Repeated Rent Defaults</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Claim: Tenant failed to make timely rent payments, justifying termination under Section 24(f) of the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Relevant Lease Clauses: Section 24(f) (Repeated Default), Section 24(a)(i) (Cure Period for Rent Defaults), and Section 36 (Notice Requirements).</ul></li>
<ol>2. <strong>Operational Non-Compliance</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Claim: The premises are being operated as a bar in violation of Section 7(b) of the lease, which prohibits the operation of a bar and requires food to be the primary source of revenue.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Relevant Lease Clauses: Section 7(a) (Permitted Use) and 7(b) (Prohibition Against Operating as a Bar).</ul></li>
<ol>3. <strong>Insurance Lapse</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Claim: A lapse in required insurance coverage constitutes a breach of the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Relevant Lease Clause: Section 24(a)(ii) (Cure Period for Non-Rent Defaults).</ul></li>
<ol>4. <strong>Termination Notice Requirements</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Issue: The termination notice allegedly failed to comply with the certified mail requirement in Section 36 of the lease.</ul>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Tenant’s Arguments and Evidence</strong></h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Rent Defaults</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - <strong>Lack of Proper Notice</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Section 24(f) requires written notice of defaults to establish a claim of repeated default.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No formal written notices were issued for past defaults.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Premature Termination Notice</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">September 25 “Pay or Quit” notice demanded $4,600 by September 30, failing to provide the required 10-business-day cure period.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Attempts to pay before the deadline were refused (e.g., September 30 and October 4 payment attempts).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Acceptance of Late Payments</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties accepted late rent payments for 40 out of the past 45 months without objection, implying a <strong>de facto waiver</strong> of strict payment enforcement under Section 23.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Operational Compliance</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Sales Data</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">70.11% of revenue is derived from food sales, exceeding the 60% threshold required under West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Documentation of sales data attached.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Industry Practices</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Customers are allowed to finish their dining experience after closing time, which does not constitute operating as a bar.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Insurance Lapse</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Immediate Resolution</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse resulted from a payment processing issue due to fraud and has been resolved.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Lack of Written Notice</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Section 24(a)(ii) provides a 30-day cure period, but no formal written notice was issued.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>ADA Compliance and Accessibility</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Double Doors Leading to Elevator</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The only wheelchair-accessible entry to The Cellar Door is through double doors leading to an elevator. These doors are operational only during limited hours (weekday lunch hours), leaving the space inaccessible to wheelchair users during at least 50% of business hours.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The failure to maintain consistent access violates the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong>.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Security System</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The doors have a remote-access security system that allows for minimal effort to adjust access, but DBG Properties has not addressed the issue despite repeated requests since May 2017.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Trade Fixtures and Property Removal</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Section 11(e)</strong> of the lease entitles the tenant to remove trade fixtures and equipment installed for business needs.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Items to be removed include custom bars, shelving, kitchen equipment, and decorative lighting (e.g., chandeliers).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The removal of decorative lighting will not impair the premises’ functionality, as the spaces are equipped with sufficient recessed and permanent lighting.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Right to Quiet Enjoyment</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Employee Misconduct</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A DBG employee has entered The Cellar Door between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM without notice, appearing intoxicated, and has spread misinformation about the business facing eviction.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">These actions harm the business’s reputation, impede hiring efforts, and breach the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment under Section 27 of the lease.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Water Meter Issue</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Paula Vega Cupcakes, a neighboring business, shares a water meter with The Cellar Door’s kitchen. This unresolved issue raises concerns about fairness in utility billing.</ul>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Supporting Evidence</strong></h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Sales Records</strong>: Demonstrating compliance with food sales requirements.
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>September 20 Text Message</strong>: From Debbie waiving the late fee for September rent.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Pay or Quit Notice</strong>: Dated September 25, 2024.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Payment Attempts</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - September 30 payment attempt (before 5 PM).
<li class="list-disc ml-6">October 4 payment attempt (after 3:30 PM, no one available to accept payment).</ul></li>
<ol>5. <strong>Insurance Documentation</strong>: Showing resolution of the lapse.
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Photographs</strong>: Depicting accessibility challenges and ADA compliance issues.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Correspondence</strong>: Emails and written requests regarding the double doors, ADA compliance, and back door code security concerns.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Employee Turnover Data</strong>: Supporting the need for security updates.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Water Meter Documentation</strong>: Addressing the shared water meter issue.</ol></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Key Legal Points</strong></h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Failure to Provide Proper Notice</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Certified mail requirement under Section 36.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Cure periods for rent defaults (10 business days) and insurance lapses (30 days) not honored.</ul></li>
<ol>2. <strong>De Facto Waiver</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Consistent acceptance of late payments undermines the landlord’s claim of repeated default.</ul>
<ol>3. <strong>Trade Fixtures</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Right to remove fixtures like custom bars and chandeliers under Section 11(e).</ul>
<ol>4. <strong>ADA Compliance</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Inconsistent access to wheelchair-accessible entry violates federal accessibility laws.</ul>
<ol>5. <strong>Right to Quiet Enjoyment</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - Employee misconduct constitutes a breach of tenant’s rights under Section 27.</ul>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Appendix: Detailed Points of Concern</strong></h3>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h4><strong>1. Rent Defaults and Payment Attempts</strong></h4>
<strong>Key Issue</strong>: Failure to honor cure periods and refusal to accept payments.
<ul>- <strong>Relevant Lease Sections</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>: Requires written notice and a 10-business-day cure period for rent defaults.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 36</strong>: Mandates all notices be sent via certified or registered mail.</ul></li>

<strong>Details</strong>:
<ul>- <strong>September 25 Pay or Quit Notice</strong>: Demanded $4,600 by September 30, providing fewer than the required 10 business days (Sept. 28–29 fell on a weekend). Attempts to pay before the deadline were refused.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September 30 Payment Attempt</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Rent was ready to be paid before 5 PM (close of business), but DBG did not provide an alternative payment method when their staff could not accept it.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 4 Payment Attempt</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Tenant tried to pay October rent but found no one available after 3:30 PM. Rent payments for both months were available on this date but were not accepted.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 7 Payment Attempt</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Manager delivered $8,000 in cash to DBG’s office, covering both September and October rents. Payment was refused without explanation.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>De Facto Waiver</strong>: Acceptance of late rent for 40 of 45 months establishes a pattern suggesting flexibility, contrary to claims of strict enforcement.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h4><strong>2. Alleged Operational Non-Compliance</strong></h4>
<strong>Key Issue</strong>: Claims that The Cellar Door operates as a bar in violation of Section 7(b).
<ul>- <strong>Relevant Lease Sections</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(a)</strong>: Permits restaurant operation with alcohol service if food is the primary revenue source.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(b)</strong>: Prohibits operating as a bar.</ul></li>

<strong>Details</strong>:
<ul>- <strong>Sales Data</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>70.11%</strong> of revenue derives from food sales, far exceeding the 60% threshold required under West Virginia Code §60-7-2.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Total food sales: $433,910.57; Total alcohol sales: $185,023.24.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Industry Practices</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Guests are allowed to finish their dining experience after closing time, aligning with standard restaurant operations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Documentation</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Attached sales data with categorized revenue streams to substantiate compliance with lease and state law.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h4><strong>3. Insurance Lapse</strong></h4>
<strong>Key Issue</strong>: Brief lapse in one of three insurance policies due to administrative oversight.
<ul>- <strong>Relevant Lease Section</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>: Grants a 30-day cure period for non-rent defaults, including insurance lapses.</ul></li>

<strong>Details</strong>:
<ul>- Fraud led to the closure of the bank account tied to insurance payments.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Two policies were updated promptly; the third policy was overlooked by the insurer.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Once notified, steps were taken to reinstate coverage. No formal notice of the lapse was provided by DBG.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h4><strong>4. Accessibility and ADA Compliance</strong></h4>
<strong>Key Issue</strong>: Inconsistent operation of double doors leading to the elevator, creating a significant accessibility issue.
<ul>- <strong>Legal Basis</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong>: Requires public accommodations to provide consistent and reasonable access for individuals with disabilities.</ul></li>

<strong>Details</strong>:
<ul>- <strong>The Issue</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The double doors leading to the elevator, the only wheelchair-accessible entry to The Cellar Door, operate irregularly.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Doors are functional only during weekday lunch hours, leaving the space inaccessible during at least <strong>50% of operating hours</strong>.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Security System</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Doors are equipped with remote-access features (e.g., code changes, access level adjustments) that could resolve the issue with minimal effort. This capability has existed since May 2017 but has not been utilized effectively.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Impact</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The lack of reliable access creates a federal compliance issue and alienates guests requiring wheelchair access.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h4><strong>5. Trade Fixtures and Property Removal</strong></h4>
<strong>Key Issue</strong>: Ensuring clarity on the right to remove trade fixtures and equipment under Section 11(e).
<ul>- <strong>Relevant Lease Section</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 11(e)</strong>: Grants the tenant the right to remove trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment upon vacating, provided no significant damage occurs.</ul></li>

<strong>Details</strong>:
<ul>- <strong>Items to Be Removed</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Custom bars, shelving, kitchen equipment, and decorative lighting (e.g., chandeliers).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Decorative lighting includes 8 chandeliers in the event room, 6 pendant Turkish glass lights, and other decorative fixtures across both restaurants.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Premises Functionality</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Removal of decorative lighting will not impair functionality, as spaces are adequately equipped with recessed and permanent lighting.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Commitment to Repairs</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Tenant will repair any minor damages (e.g., filling mounting holes) caused by removals.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Significance</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">These fixtures were installed to create a unique dining atmosphere critical to the business's USP and serve as trade fixtures under legal definitions.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h4><strong>6. Quiet Enjoyment</strong></h4>
<strong>Key Issue</strong>: Employee misconduct and misinformation spread about the tenant’s eviction.
<ul>- <strong>Relevant Lease Section</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 27</strong>: Guarantees the tenant’s right to peaceably and quietly hold the premises.</ul></li>

<strong>Details</strong>:
<ul>- <strong>Employee Misconduct</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A DBG employee has entered the premises unannounced during early morning hours (3:00 AM–5:00 AM), potentially under the influence of alcohol.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Harmful Communications</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The same employee has spread rumors in Huntington about the tenant’s alleged eviction, harming the business’s reputation and hindering hiring efforts.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Impact</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">This conduct breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment and directly affects the tenant’s operations.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h4><strong>7. Water Meter Issue</strong></h4>
<strong>Key Issue</strong>: Paula Vega Cupcakes, a neighboring business, shares a water meter with The Cellar Door’s kitchen.
<ul>- <strong>Details</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Raises fairness concerns regarding utility billing.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Requests to address this issue have not been resolved by DBG Properties.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
