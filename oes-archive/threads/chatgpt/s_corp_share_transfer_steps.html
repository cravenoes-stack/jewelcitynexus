                            <div class="message-text">When your partner wants to exit the S corporation and transfer their 50% ownership to you, there are several legal steps you need to follow to ensure the transfer is properly executed. Here’s an outline of the steps:

<h3>1. <strong>Review the Shareholders' Agreement</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Check the Agreement:</strong> If your S corporation has a shareholders' agreement, review it for any provisions regarding the transfer of shares. The agreement might outline the process for transferring shares, including any rights of first refusal, approval from other shareholders, or valuation methods.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Buy-Sell Agreement:</strong> If there’s a buy-sell agreement, it will dictate the terms under which a partner can sell their shares.</ul></li>

<h3>2. <strong>Valuation of Shares</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Determine the Value:</strong> The shares need to be valued to determine a fair price. This can be done through various methods such as a formal appraisal, agreement between the partners, or according to a formula in the shareholders' agreement.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Negotiate Price:</strong> Once the value is determined, negotiate the price and terms of payment if the shares are being sold rather than gifted.</ul></li>

<h3>3. <strong>Draft a Share Transfer Agreement</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Document the Transfer:</strong> A formal agreement should be drafted to document the transfer of shares. This agreement should outline the terms of the transfer, including the number of shares, the price (if applicable), and any other relevant terms.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Legal Counsel:</strong> It’s advisable to have an attorney draft or review the agreement to ensure it complies with state laws and any corporate governance documents.</ul></li>

<h3>4. <strong>Execute the Share Transfer</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Sign the Agreement:</strong> Both you and your partner need to sign the share transfer agreement.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Endorse Stock Certificates:</strong> If physical stock certificates were issued, they should be endorsed by your partner and transferred to you.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Update Stock Ledger:</strong> The corporation’s stock ledger must be updated to reflect the transfer of shares from your partner to you.</ul></li>

<h3>5. <strong>Notify the IRS</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>File Form 2553 (If Needed):</strong> Although an S corp’s status usually remains unaffected by changes in ownership, you should ensure that the corporation continues to meet the S corporation eligibility requirements. If there are concerns about eligibility, you may need to file or amend IRS Form 2553.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Schedule K-1:</strong> Your partner should receive a final Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S) reflecting their share of the corporation's income, deductions, and credits up to the date of the transfer.</ul></li>

<h3>6. <strong>Update State and Local Filings</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>State Filing Requirements:</strong> Some states require updates to the ownership records with the state. Check with your state’s business registration office to determine if any forms need to be filed.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Amend Operating Agreement:</strong> If your corporation has an operating agreement or bylaws, you might need to amend these documents to reflect the change in ownership.</ul></li>

<h3>7. <strong>Notify Banks and Other Third Parties</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Bank Accounts:</strong> Update the corporation’s bank accounts and financial institutions to reflect the new ownership structure.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Contracts:</strong> Review any contracts or agreements where the ownership structure is relevant and notify the other parties if necessary.</ul></li>

<h3>8. <strong>Consider Tax Implications</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Capital Gains Tax:</strong> Your partner may be subject to capital gains tax on the sale of the shares.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Gift Tax (If Applicable):</strong> If the shares are being gifted rather than sold, consider any gift tax implications. The IRS requires a gift tax return (Form 709) to be filed for gifts exceeding the annual exclusion.</ul></li>

<h3>9. <strong>Consult with Professionals</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Legal Counsel:</strong> Engage an attorney to guide you through the process and ensure compliance with legal requirements.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Tax Advisor:</strong> Consult with a tax advisor to understand the tax implications for both you and your partner.</ul></li>

Once all these steps are completed, you will be the sole owner of the S corporation, and the transition will be properly documented and legally sound.</div>

                            <div class="message-text">If your partner literally gives you their shares in the S corporation without any payment in return, this is considered a gift under U.S. tax law. Here are the tax implications for you as the recipient:

<h3>1. <strong>Gift Tax Implications for Your Partner</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Gift Tax Responsibility:</strong> The gift tax is generally the responsibility of the donor (your partner) and not the recipient (you). 
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Annual Exclusion:</strong> For 2024, the annual gift tax exclusion amount is $17,000 per recipient. If the value of the shares exceeds this amount, your partner will need to file a gift tax return (IRS Form 709).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Lifetime Exclusion:</strong> The lifetime gift tax exemption for 2024 is $12.92 million. If the value of the gift exceeds the annual exclusion, it will reduce your partner’s lifetime exclusion amount, but unless your partner’s total lifetime gifts exceed this amount, no gift tax will be owed.</ul></li>

<h3>2. <strong>Your Basis in the Shares</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Carryover Basis:</strong> When you receive the shares as a gift, your tax basis in the shares is generally the same as your partner’s basis in those shares. This is known as a “carryover basis.” 
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Potential Capital Gains:</strong> If you later sell the shares, your taxable gain (or loss) will be calculated based on this carryover basis. If the value of the shares has appreciated since your partner acquired them, you may have a larger capital gain when you sell.</ul></li>

<h3>3. <strong>No Immediate Income Tax Consequences</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>No Income Recognition:</strong> Receiving shares as a gift does not trigger any immediate income tax for you. You will not owe any taxes at the time of the gift.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Dividends and Distributions:</strong> Once you own the shares, any dividends or distributions from the S corporation will be taxable to you according to the normal S corporation rules.</ul></li>

<h3>4. <strong>State Tax Considerations</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>State Gift Taxes:</strong> While most states do not impose a gift tax, you should verify whether your state has any specific rules or requirements related to the transfer of shares.</ul>

<h3>5. <strong>Recordkeeping</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Documentation:</strong> Ensure that the gift is properly documented with a gift letter or a formal transfer document, and retain records of the original basis of the shares from your partner.</ul>

<h3>6. <strong>Future Tax Planning</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Estate Planning:</strong> Since you now own 100% of the corporation, consider updating your estate plan to reflect this change. It may be beneficial to consult with a tax advisor or estate planner.</ul>

In summary, as the recipient of the gift, you do not have immediate tax liability. However, the carryover basis will affect the amount of capital gains tax you might owe if you sell the shares in the future. Your partner is responsible for any gift tax implications, but this will depend on the value of the shares and their lifetime gifting history.</div>

<h3>Plan of Action After Dakota's Exit</h3>

Given that Dakota Maddox was responsible for catering, special events, marketing, and front-of-house hiring, her exit will require a strategic redistribution of responsibilities to ensure smooth operations. Here's a plan of action:

<strong>1. Transition of Responsibilities</strong>
<ul>   - <strong>Catering & Special Events Coordination:</strong>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Identify a Successor:</strong> Assign someone from within the organization or hire externally to take over Dakota's role as the Special Event Coordinator.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Documentation:</strong> Ensure that all ongoing contracts, client relationships, and event plans are well documented. Conduct a knowledge transfer session with Dakota before her exit to capture her insights and methodologies.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Training:</strong> Provide training for the new coordinator on the existing processes and client expectations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Marketing Responsibilities:</strong></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Interim Solution:</strong> Until a permanent replacement is found, consider temporarily outsourcing marketing functions or delegating to a current employee with marketing experience.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Hiring:</strong> Start the process of recruiting a new marketing manager who will be responsible for maintaining and growing the restaurant’s brand presence.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Marketing Strategy Review:</strong> Review and update the current marketing strategy to ensure continuity and adjust it according to any new goals or changes in the business.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Front-of-House Hiring:</strong></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Delegation:</strong> Reassign front-of-house hiring duties to the existing management team, or consider hiring a dedicated HR manager or consultant to handle this aspect.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Process Review:</strong> Evaluate the current hiring process to ensure that it meets the restaurant’s standards and make any necessary improvements.</ul></li>

<strong>2. Client Communication</strong>
<ul>   - <strong>Notify Clients:</strong> Inform key clients, especially those related to catering and special events, about the transition. Assure them of the continuity of service and introduce them to the new contact person.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Public Announcement:</strong> Consider making a public announcement about the changes in leadership, particularly if Dakota was a well-known figure in your business. This could be done via your website, social media, or a press release.</ul></li>

<strong>3. Operational Adjustments</strong>
<ul>   - <strong>Reassess Workload:</strong> Review the current workload of your remaining staff to ensure they can handle the additional responsibilities. Consider hiring additional staff if necessary.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Review Financials:</strong> Reassess the budget and financials in light of Dakota’s exit, particularly focusing on areas like marketing and event planning.</ul></li>

<strong>4. Legal & Administrative</strong>
<ul>   - <strong>Update Corporate Documents:</strong> Ensure that corporate documents reflect the change in ownership and responsibilities, including any necessary amendments to the operating agreement, stock ledger, and board minutes.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Contracts and Agreements:</strong> Review any contracts or agreements that Dakota was involved with, particularly those related to catering and special events, to ensure they are properly managed going forward.</ul></li>

<strong>5. Strategic Planning</strong>
<ul>   - <strong>Long-term Strategy:</strong> Develop a long-term strategy to address how the business will evolve without Dakota’s involvement. This could include redefining roles, exploring new business opportunities, or shifting the focus of certain aspects of the business.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Team Meeting:</strong> Hold a meeting with your management team to discuss the changes, gather input, and ensure everyone is aligned with the new direction.</ul></li>

<strong>6. Emotional and Cultural Considerations</strong>
<ul>   - <strong>Team Morale:</strong> Address any concerns your team may have about the transition. Keep communication open and transparent to maintain morale and ensure everyone feels supported.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Preserve Culture:</strong> Make sure that the core values and culture of the business remain intact during the transition.</ul></li>

This plan should help you manage the transition smoothly, ensuring that the business continues to operate effectively and efficiently.</div>

<h3>Key Modifications to the Draft Agreement:</h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Pre-Emptive Rights and Right of First Refusal:</strong></ol>
<ul>   - The original Shareholder Agreement includes pre-emptive rights and rights of first refusal for share transfers, which may require the other shareholders to be offered the shares before they can be transferred. However, since the other shareholders backed out before the final purchase, and only you and Dakota remain, these provisions are not applicable. Thus, you can proceed with the direct transfer.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notice Requirement:</strong></ol></li>
<ul>   - The Shareholder Agreement requires that any share transfer be communicated and documented properly. Ensure that this gift transfer is recorded in the corporate records, and that Navi Inc.'s stock ledger is updated to reflect the new ownership.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Shotgun Clause & Dispute Resolution:</strong></ol></li>

                            <div class="message-text"><h3>Detailed Exit Strategy and Plan of Action for Dakota Maddox’s Departure</h3>

Given Dakota Maddox’s significant role in your business as the Special Event Coordinator and primary Marketing Specialist, her departure will require a well-structured exit strategy to ensure a smooth transition and maintain the operations’ continuity. Here’s a comprehensive plan:

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3>1. <strong>Initial Assessment and Transition Planning</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Meeting with Dakota:</strong> Schedule a meeting with Dakota to discuss her departure timeline, current projects, and any ongoing responsibilities. This meeting should aim to identify critical areas that need immediate attention and agree on a transition timeline.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Documenting Responsibilities:</strong> Work with Dakota to create a detailed document listing all her current responsibilities, including specific tasks, key contacts, ongoing projects, and critical deadlines. This document will serve as a guide for whoever takes over her duties.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Identify Key Projects:</strong> Identify which of Dakota’s ongoing projects are the most critical. Prioritize these for early transition to ensure no disruption in operations.</ul></li>

<h3>2. <strong>Delegation of Responsibilities</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Interim Role Assignments:</strong> 
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Special Event Coordination:</strong> Identify a current staff member who could temporarily manage special events or hire an external consultant to handle this role until a permanent replacement is found.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Marketing Duties:</strong> Consider temporarily outsourcing marketing activities to a marketing agency or assigning duties to an existing team member with experience in marketing.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Front-of-House Hiring:</strong> Delegate front-of-house hiring responsibilities to a trusted manager or consider hiring an HR specialist or consultant to take over this role.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Cross-Training:</strong> Initiate cross-training sessions where Dakota can train designated staff members on her key responsibilities. This will ensure that knowledge is transferred effectively and that operations can continue smoothly even after her departure.</ul></li>

<h3>3. <strong>Hiring and Recruitment</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Recruitment Plan:</strong> 
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Special Event Coordinator:</strong> Develop a job description for the Special Event Coordinator position, emphasizing skills in event planning, client management, and logistical coordination. Begin the recruitment process immediately, aiming to have a new hire in place before Dakota’s exit.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Marketing Specialist:</strong> Similarly, develop a job description for a Marketing Specialist or Manager. The new hire should have experience in digital marketing, social media, and promotional strategies specific to the restaurant and hospitality industry.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Temporary Coverage:</strong> If a permanent replacement is not found before Dakota’s exit, ensure that interim arrangements are in place, such as part-time consultants or temporary employees, to handle her duties.</ul></li>

<h3>4. <strong>Client and Stakeholder Communication</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Client Transition Plan:</strong> 
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Key Clients:</strong> Dakota should personally introduce her replacement or the interim contact to key clients, particularly those involved in ongoing or upcoming special events. This will help maintain client relationships and reassure them of continued quality service.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Formal Announcement:</strong> Draft a formal communication to be sent to clients, vendors, and other stakeholders announcing Dakota’s departure and introducing her replacement. This communication should emphasize continuity and stability in the services provided.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Public Announcement:</strong> Prepare a public announcement to be shared via social media, your website, and possibly a press release, depending on Dakota’s visibility in the business. This announcement should highlight her contributions and introduce the new or interim staff taking over her responsibilities.</ul></li>

<h3>5. <strong>Operational Adjustments</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Process Review:</strong> Conduct a review of all processes that Dakota was involved in, particularly those related to event planning and marketing. Identify any potential areas for improvement and streamline processes where possible.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Technology and Tools:</strong> Ensure that Dakota’s replacement is proficient with any software or tools she used, such as event management software, marketing platforms, or HR systems. Arrange for training if necessary.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Knowledge Transfer:</strong></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Document Processes:</strong> Work with Dakota to document all key processes, including how she managed events, executed marketing campaigns, and conducted front-of-house hiring. This documentation will be vital for training her successor and ensuring consistency.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Access and Permissions:</strong> Review and update access to any systems or accounts that Dakota had, ensuring that her replacement has the necessary permissions and that any unnecessary access is revoked upon her departure.</ul></li>

<h3>6. <strong>Legal and Administrative Considerations</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Update Corporate Documents:</strong> 
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Resignation Letter:</strong> Obtain a formal resignation letter from Dakota, stating her last working day and the agreed-upon terms of her departure.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Amendments:</strong> If Dakota was listed as an officer in any corporate documents, such as in the Shareholder Agreement or corporate filings, ensure these are updated to reflect her departure.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Employee Records:</strong> Ensure that Dakota’s employee records are up-to-date, including documentation of her final salary, any severance arrangements, and the transfer of any benefits or shares.</ul></li>

<h3>7. <strong>Marketing and Branding Continuity</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Review Marketing Strategy:</strong>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Campaigns:</strong> Review any ongoing or planned marketing campaigns that Dakota was handling. Ensure that her replacement has a clear understanding of the strategy and is prepared to continue these campaigns without interruption.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Brand Messaging:</strong> Conduct a review of the brand messaging to ensure consistency during the transition. The new marketing lead should be well-versed in the brand’s voice and strategic goals.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Social Media and Digital Presence:</strong></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Content Calendar:</strong> If Dakota managed social media, ensure that there is a content calendar in place to guide the transition period. The calendar should include scheduled posts, promotional events, and any ongoing digital marketing efforts.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Social Media Management:</strong> Determine who will take over social media management. If Dakota used specific tools or platforms for scheduling posts and monitoring engagement, ensure that the new person is trained on these tools.</ul></li>

<h3>8. <strong>Exit Interview and Feedback</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Conduct Exit Interview:</strong> Schedule an exit interview with Dakota to gather her insights on her role, the challenges she faced, and her suggestions for improvement. This can provide valuable feedback for future hiring and operations.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Feedback Integration:</strong> Consider integrating Dakota’s feedback into your ongoing business strategy, particularly in the areas she was most involved in, such as event planning and marketing.</ul></li>

<h3>9. <strong>Post-Exit Follow-Up</strong></h3>
<ul>   - <strong>Continued Communication:</strong> Maintain an open line of communication with Dakota for a short period after her exit in case any issues arise or further knowledge transfer is needed.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Review Transition:</strong> After Dakota’s departure, review the transition process to identify any gaps or issues that may need to be addressed. Ensure that her replacement or interim solutions are effectively managing her former responsibilities.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Staff Morale:</strong> Keep an eye on staff morale during and after the transition. Make sure that the team feels supported and that any concerns are addressed promptly to avoid disruptions to the work environment.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3>Timeline for Execution:</h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Initial meeting with Dakota, documentation of responsibilities, start recruitment process.
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Cross-training sessions, client transition communications, interim role assignments.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Week 5-6:</strong> Conduct exit interview, finalize legal and administrative updates, and formal announcement of Dakota’s departure.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Week 7+:</strong> Ongoing support for new hires or interim staff, review transition effectiveness, and address any emerging issues.</ol></li>

This detailed plan should help ensure a smooth transition as Dakota exits her roles in the business, maintaining continuity and stability in both special events coordination and marketing efforts.</div>

	•	Chairs positioned every two feet along the table with the front legs of the chairs being in line with the edge of the table
	•	Room Setup & all catering displays in place prior to host arrival unless the host is arriving more than 45 minutes before the start of the event

	•	FOH Event Staff: 1 per 18-25 people (depending on structure of alcohol sales and expected alcohol sales volume)

(<strong><em>Note: If the event is less than 24 hours out at the time of booking, the menu selection must be determined during the initial client correspondence</em></strong>)

	•	Catering line 
	•	Catering Phone stays at Le Bistro & The Cellar Door
	•	Phone will be manager on duty’s responsibility

	•	All catering consultations regarding menu selection and event specifics will be scheduled to be held in person with a minimum of 2 managers present, preferably one of which being either a chef or Chris. When an in-person consultation is not possible or unnecessary due to client availability or simplicity of event, the consultation is to adhere to the aforementioned specifications via Skype, FaceTime, Phone Conference Call, or something similar. <strong><em> In the circumstance that the client is comfortable with, and specifically prefers to communicate strictly with the written word, all correspondence must be recorded and easily accessed by all other members of management (must follow the “follow-up guidelines” listed below ESPECIALLY if correspondence occurs via text message on your personal line)</em></strong>
	•	Anytime a catering inquiry comes in through Le Bistro or Cellar Door’s direct phone line, employees will now be instructed to give the phone to the manager that is physically closest to said employee. All manager’s will share responsibility in ensuring timely initial contact. 
	•	All correspondence with catering / special event clients will adhere to the following guidelines:
	•	All phone conversations will be followed up with either 
	•	A follow up email summarizing the details of the conversation with the info@lebistrowv.com and any other related management party cc’d on the email (Preferred method)
	•	A text message (only when preferred communication by catering client) summarizing the details of the conversation with the dedicated catering cell phone. If it makes sense to include another phone line in the conversation to ensure all relevant members of management are updated, the initial text message can be in a group text; all group text communications MUST include the dedicated catering phone line
	•	All follow up emails will include a call to action in the conclusion. For example:
	•	Initial contact follow up email: “Are you available Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday between 2pm & 6pm this week or the week following to meet regarding menu selection, venue specifics and any other notable event details?”
	•	Catering Consultation follow up email: “As per our discussion in our meeting this afternoon, the attached tentative invoice includes pricing for each option discussed. If you have any questions about the menu selection, pricing, or additional options, please contact me at the information listed below. The hold on your event date will remain tentative until an invoice is confirmed for your event or your event deposit is paid. I will give you a follow up call Friday evening between 5pm and 8pm. We need finalized guest count and menu selection no later than 7 days prior to your event to ensure appropriate staffing and ordering.”
	•	Menu Confirmation follow up email: “We’re excited to host your event! Attached is the confirmed invoice detailing menu selection and other event specifics discussed. Did we cover all of the bases or is there anything else we need to include / modifications you would like us to make?”
	•	All catering correspondence will adhere to the 24 hour or less response guideline, with our management team committing to the shared goal of immediate response to our clients when at all possible.</div>
