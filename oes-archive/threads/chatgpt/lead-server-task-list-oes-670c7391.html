   - Make sure all glassware, silverware, and dishes are cleaned and stored properly.
   - Confirm that all chairs are stacked (if applicable) or tables are neatly arranged.
   - Wipe down and restock beverage stations.

2. **Bar &amp; Beverage Station Close:**
   - Ensure all remaining beverages and garnishes are properly stored or disposed of.
   - Clean and organize the bar area, including bar tools and glassware.
   - Lock up alcohol as per company policy.

3. **End of Day Reporting:**
   - Review and close out POS systems.
   - Handle any closing financial reporting (cash-out, tips, credit card receipts).
   - Ensure all necessary closing paperwork (inventory, sales) is completed and submitted.

4. **Final Checks:**
   - Secure the restaurant by checking that all doors are locked, equipment is turned off, and the lights are out.
   - Make sure the bar and kitchen (if applicable) are prepped and ready for the next shift.
   - Leave any important notes for the next shift in the log book or scheduling app.
