                <div class="message-content">To adapt the "Perfect Match" game for a group of people, some of whom are friends and others who barely know each other, and to make it competitive on an individual basis, you could implement the following changes to the rules:

### Revised Rules for Group Play:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to score the most points by correctly predicting how well you know each other.

2. **Setup**:
   - Each person receives a notepad or piece of paper and a pen.
   - Shuffle the deck of question cards and place them in the center of the table.
   - Everyone writes their name on their notepad.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - **Turn Order**: Choose someone to draw a question card first (rotate clockwise afterward).
   - The player drawing the card asks the question aloud. Instead of answering for themselves, they will predict how another player (chosen randomly or in turn) would answer the question.
   - Everyone else writes down how *they* think the chosen player would answer the question on their own notepads.
   - After everyone has written their answers, the chosen player reveals their actual answer.

4. **Scoring**:
   - Each player who correctly guessed the chosen player's answer receives 1 point.
   - If the person asking the question also correctly predicts the chosen player's answer, they earn 1 bonus point.
   - No points are awarded if the chosen player gives a completely new or undecided answer (e.g., selecting ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù without further clarification).

5. **Rounds**:
   - The game continues for 10 rounds or until the question cards are exhausted.
   - At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.

6. **Optional Bonus**: 
   - For more group engagement, you could have a ‚Äúwild card‚Äù round where, after 5 rounds, everyone has to predict the group‚Äôs most popular answer to a question, with an extra 2 points for correct predictions.

These changes should encourage everyone to participate equally, even if they are not well-acquainted with each other, while keeping the game lighthearted and competitive.</div>
