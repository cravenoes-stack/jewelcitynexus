Event Themes: Unique, marketable concepts tailored to each venue.
Detailed Plans: Menus, beverage offerings, décor, marketing strategies, staff roles, and guest experiences.
Supporting Documents: Visual guides, signage templates, marketing tools, feedback forms, and troubleshooting plans.
Operational Precision: A timeline, financial planning, and contingency plans for flawless execution.
Your Specific Expectations:
The guide and supporting materials should be thorough, polished, and actionable.
All content should reflect industry best practices, ensuring nothing is overlooked.
The end result should rival the quality of work produced by top-tier event planners.
Current Status:
The comprehensive guide is complete and delivered.
The supporting documents are partially done, with missing elements like:

<strong>1. Table Setup Guides and Napkin Folding Instructions</strong>

<strong>Le Bistro: “The Green Gala” – Table Setup</strong>  
<strong>Concept:</strong> Elegant, nature-inspired tablescapes emphasizing sustainability.

<strong>Essential Elements:</strong>  
<ul>- Recycled glass chargers and dinner plates.  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Linen napkins in soft green shades.  </li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Gold-toned flatware.  </li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Potted succulents or herb centerpieces.  </li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Soy candles in sustainable holders.</ul></li>

<strong>Step-by-Step Table Setup:</strong>  
<ol>1. <strong>Table Linens:</strong> Place a crisp white tablecloth made from organic cotton, ensuring it’s wrinkle-free and centered.  
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Chargers and Plates:</strong> Set a recycled glass charger at each seat, centered about 1 inch from the edge of the table. Place the dinner plate on top of the charger.  </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Flatware Placement:</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Forks (salad fork, dinner fork) on the left side of the plate, placed in order of use (salad fork outermost).  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Knife (blade facing in) and spoon on the right side of the plate.  </li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Dessert spoon or fork can be placed horizontally above the plate if served as a dedicated course.  </ul></li>
<ol>4. <strong>Glassware:</strong>  </ol>
<ul>   - Place the water glass above the knife.  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Wine glasses to the right of the water glass, arranged in order of service (white wine glass closest, then red behind).  </ul></li>
<ol>5. <strong>Napkin Placement:</strong>  </ol>
<ul>   - Fold the napkin into the “Fan Fold” (instructions below) and place it standing upright inside the empty water glass or arranged elegantly on the plate if preferred.  </ul>
<ol>6. <strong>Centerpieces:</strong>  </ol>
<ul>   - Position a small potted succulent or herb planter in the center, ensuring it doesn’t obstruct guests’ view of each other.  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Place soy candles in simple glass holders interspersed around the centerpiece to provide a warm, inviting glow.  </ul></li>
<ol>7. <strong>Finishing Touches:</strong>  </ol>
<ul>   - Double-check alignment: chairs should be evenly spaced, each setting uniform and symmetrical.  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Add menu cards made from recycled paper above the charger or tucked into the napkin.</ul></li>

<strong>Le Bistro Napkin Fold: “Fan Fold”</strong>  
<ol>1. Lay a clean linen napkin flat, with one edge facing you.  
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Fold the napkin in half horizontally (bottom edge up to top), creating a long rectangle.  </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Starting from the bottom edge, make an accordion-style fold, about 1–1.5 inches wide, folding back and forth until the entire napkin is folded.  </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Fold the pleated napkin in half so the pleats fan out at the top.  </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Place the base of the folded napkin either in a glass or on the plate, gently fanning out the top for a dramatic yet refined look.</ol></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>The Cellar Door: “Neon Noir” – Table Setup (For VIP Lounges and High-Tops)</strong>  
<strong>Concept:</strong> Edgy neon touches, sleek black linens, and UV-reactive elements.

<strong>Essential Elements:</strong>  
<ul>- Black linens and sleek black plates (or white plates with neon edging if available).  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Flatware with a matte black finish.  </li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">UV-reactive coasters or neon-accented napkins.  </li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Small LED accents as centerpieces (e.g., a neon acrylic centerpiece or LED candle).</ul></li>

<strong>Step-by-Step Table Setup (High-Top Cocktail Table):</strong>  
<ol>1. <strong>Linens:</strong> Drape a fitted black spandex cover over the high-top table for a sleek, modern look.  
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Plates and Flatware:</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - For lounge and cocktail areas, you may set a stack of appetizer plates centrally or roll flatware in a napkin for self-service.  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">If individually set: place a black appetizer plate at each seat, and set a matte black fork on top or to the side.  </ul></li>
<ol>3. <strong>Glassware:</strong>  </ol>
<ul>   - Position neon-accented cocktail napkins or UV-reactive coasters where glasses will be placed.  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Keep glassware at the bar or serve upon guest arrival.  </ul></li>
<ol>4. <strong>Centerpieces:</strong>  </ol>
<ul>   - A small LED-lit acrylic block or neon sculpture in the center.  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Optional: A small bowl of neon glow bracelets or LED stirrers for guests to enjoy.  </ul></li>
<ol>5. <strong>Finishing Touches:</strong>  </ol>
<ul>   - Ensure any signage (like a drinks menu) is displayed in a UV-lit acrylic frame.  
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Keep the setup minimal and edgy—less clutter, more visual impact.</ul></li>

<strong>The Cellar Door Napkin Fold: “Pocket Fold”</strong>  
<ol>1. Lay the napkin flat, “finished” side down.  
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Fold it in half vertically, bringing the right side over to the left.  </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Fold the bottom edge up about one-third of the way to create a pocket.  </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Flip the napkin over, keeping the pocket intact.  </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Fold the right third of the napkin toward the center, then the left third over that, creating a neat, rectangular napkin with a front pocket.  </li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Insert utensils or a menu card into the pocket. For a neon touch, choose napkins with a vibrant edge or tuck a neon-accented menu inside.</ol></li>
