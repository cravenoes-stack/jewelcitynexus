                <div class="message-content">The Excel file contains multiple sheets with varied data structures. Here is a brief overview of the contents of each sheet:

1. **Sheet1** and **Sheet1 (2)**: These sheets seem to contain payroll cost data for 2021, including information related to ERTC (Employee Retention Tax Credit) and PPP (Paycheck Protection Program). The data includes columns for loan amounts, payroll savings, and net costs.

2. **Sheet5**: This sheet contains a simple list of savings, including cash app deposits and other types of cash deposits.

3. **Sheet4**: Appears to detail operating expenses for a specific month (March 2022), including essential utilities like electric, gas, and water, with a note about an average cost per square foot.

4. **Sheet6**: Contains a review of invoices related to POS (Point of Sale) Lavu, listing specific dates, amounts, and types of charges (e.g., tableside service, convenience fees).

                </div>
                <div class="message-content">**Sheet6** contains data on POS Lavu invoice reviews. The data is structured as follows:

- **Date**: The first column ("POS Lavu Invoice Review") lists the dates when specific charges were recorded.
- **Amount**: The second column (Unnamed: 1) provides the corresponding amounts charged on those dates.
- **Description**: The third column (Unnamed: 2) describes the type of charge, such as "Tableside" or "Convenience fee."

The sheet seems to track recurring charges, likely for a POS system, with "Tableside" service being the most frequently mentioned. The amounts associated with "Tableside" are consistently $75.00, while the "Convenience fee" appears less frequently and has a lower amount.

                <div class="message-content">Here is a detailed analysis of the data in **Sheet6**:

### Summary by Description:
- **Tableside**:
  - **Total Amount**: $225.00
  - **Count**: 3 occurrences
  - **Average Amount per Charge**: $75.00

- **Convenience fee**:
  - **Total Amount**: $12.58
  - **Count**: 1 occurrence
  - **Average Amount per Charge**: $12.58

### Monthly Trends:
- **March 2022**:
  - **Total Amount**: $87.58
  - **Count**: 2 charges (one "Tableside" and one "Convenience fee")

- **April 2022**:
  - **Total Amount**: $75.00
  - **Count**: 1 charge (only "Tableside")

- **May 2022**:
  - **Total Amount**: $75.00
  - **Count**: 1 charge (only "Tableside")

                <div class="message-content">To analyze the ERTC (Employee Retention Tax Credit) and PPP (Paycheck Protection Program) data, I'll focus on the relevant sheets (Sheet1 and Sheet1 (2)) that contain payroll costs and related financial information. I'll look for data that specifically addresses these programs and provide insights on loan amounts, payroll savings, and net costs.

Let's proceed by analyzing the relevant data points.</div>

                <div class="message-content">It seems that the structure of the data in **Sheet1** is more complex than initially anticipated, with an unexpected number of columns. I'll recheck the data structure and proceed accordingly. Let me correct this and proceed with the analysis.</div>

                <div class="message-content">The data in **Sheet1** has a different column structure than I initially assumed, with 12 columns. The columns are a mix of named and unnamed ones. I'll adjust the approach to focus on the columns relevant to ERTC, PPP, payroll savings, and net costs. Let me try to isolate the data specifically related to these topics and provide the analysis.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="message-content">The data structure includes relevant information regarding ERTC, PPP, and payroll. Here's a breakdown of what each column represents:

- **ERTC**: Likely indicates the Employee Retention Tax Credit percentage or related values.
- **PPP_Period**: Contains payroll-related amounts or periods under the PPP program.
- **Loan_amount**: Represents loan amounts associated with PPP.
- **PPP_Payroll_60%** and **PPP_Total_60%**: Seem to capture payroll costs that are 60% of the PPP, both for individual pay periods and totals.
- **Total_Payroll_Saving** and **Net_Cost**: These columns should reflect payroll savings and net costs, but they appear mostly empty in the first few rows.

Next, I'll analyze this data to provide summaries and insights on the ERTC and PPP amounts.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="message-content">Here is a summary of the key financial data related to the ERTC and PPP programs:

- **Total Loan Amount**: $321,856.58
- **Total PPP Payroll (60%)**: $400,740.33
- **Total PPP Payroll Savings (60%)**: $449,410.76

These figures represent the sums across the relevant periods for the PPP and ERTC programs. The Total Loan Amount reflects the overall funds involved, while the PPP-related totals indicate the portions of payroll costs that were covered by these programs.
