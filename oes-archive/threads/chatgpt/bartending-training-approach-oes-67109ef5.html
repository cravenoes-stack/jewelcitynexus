                <div class="message-content">Hello my bartender staff! I will be sharing many things in this chat in the coming days, as you are all learning the way we operate. I am taking an unconventional approach in your training in that you are learning how to create well balanced, universally palatable drinks consistently before learning the grunt work that goes into being a great bartender. As such, you all need to know that as I am introducing you to the "grunt" work, it needs the same level of attention as does the mixology aspect of your training. Some of you may friend that bartending is not for you... too much work, too long of hours, to much of being right in guest face for the entire night, etc. Regardless of how that works out for each of you, I want to reiterate that dedication, hard work, and committing to being a strong, competent bartender will supercede seniority always. So, if you want the shifts you want... commit to being great and doing all your ish.</div>

                <div class="message-content">Hello Team,

As you all embark on this journey of becoming skilled bartenders, I want to take a moment to reinforce the foundation of how we operate here. Iâ€™m taking a slightly unconventional approach by focusing first on helping you master the craft of making balanced, universally appealing drinks consistently. The goal is to build your confidence and abilities in creating excellent cocktails, which is essential. However, this is just one part of what makes a great bartender.

Soon, we'll dive into the less glamorous but equally important aspects of the jobâ€”the "grunt" work. Whether it's cleaning, stocking, or managing the flow of the bar, these tasks are just as crucial to your success as crafting the perfect drink. The attention to detail you apply to mixology should also be applied to these responsibilities. Itâ€™s all part of being a well-rounded, competent bartender.

Bartending isnâ€™t for everyone, and some of you may discover that the long hours, physical demands, and constant interaction with guests are not what you expected. Thatâ€™s okay. But for those of you who want to thrive and secure the shifts you desire, know that your dedication, hard work, and consistent performance will always outweigh seniority. You have control over your success, and it starts with committing fully to being greatâ€”both behind the bar and in the background work.

I'm excited to see how you all grow and become better bartenders, but remember, it takes more than just making good drinks. Itâ€™s about being a strong, reliable team player, no matter what task youâ€™re doing.

Bartending isnâ€™t for everyone, and some of you may discover that the long hours, physical demands, and constant interaction with guests are not what you expected. Thatâ€™s okay.

So, if you find bartending isnâ€™t quite your fit, know that there are still opportunities within the team to shine in other roles.

For those of you who want to thrive and secure the shifts you desire, know that your dedication, hard work, and consistent performance will always outweigh seniority.

Hello Team,

Iâ€™m taking a slightly unconventional approach by focusing first on helping you master the craft of making balanced, universally appealing drinks consistently. The reason behind this strategy is simple: the popular bars in Huntington have long-term bartenders whoâ€™ve built strong followings. To compete and regain market share, we need to stand out by consistently delivering great experiences. This approach is workingâ€”so pay attention to what guests compliment us on, what drinks they request, and what keeps them coming back.
