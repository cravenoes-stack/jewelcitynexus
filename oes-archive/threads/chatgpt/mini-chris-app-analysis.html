To better understand this, you might consider the following steps:

1. **Inspect the File Properties:** Check the file's metadata for details like version history, developer information, and digital signatures.

2. **Analyze the Code:** If possible, decompile or inspect the app's code to identify hidden functionalities, activation methods, or disguised behaviors.

3. **Monitor System Activity:** Use system monitoring tools to track any unusual processes, network activity, or resource usage when the app is active.

4. **Check for Hidden Triggers:** The app may be activated through unconventional methods like specific gestures, codes, or environmental triggers.

5. **Security Software Analysis:** Run the app through advanced security software to detect hidden components or behaviors.

Let me know if you'd like more detailed guidance on any of these steps or if you have specific observations about the app's behavior.</pre></div></body></html>
