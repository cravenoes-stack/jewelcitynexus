                            <div class="message-text">Based on the information and documents you have provided, here is a summary of the current situation regarding the lease:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notice to Pay or Quit (September 25, 2024)</strong>: The landlord issued a notice demanding payment of $4,600, comprising $4,000 in past rent for September 2024 and $600 in late fees. This notice gave you five days to make the payment.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Attempt to Resolve Payment (Text Messages)</strong>: You responded to the landlord on the due date, indicating your effort to transfer $4,000 but were informed that Logan, a representative, could not accept the payment.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notice of Lease Default (October 1, 2024)</strong>: Following this, the landlord sent a notice of default, listing three reasons: failure to pay rent, repeated late payments, and failure to follow lease provisions. The landlord is seeking to terminate the lease.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Your Response (October 2, 2024)</strong>: You objected to this termination, citing the lease agreement's Section 24, which gives you 10 business days to cure any default after notice. You pointed out that the "Pay or Quit" notice was issued on September 25, 2024, and you were still within the 10-day period when the notice of default was issued. Additionally, you referenced Section 36, which requires notices to be delivered via certified or registered mail.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notice of Lease Termination (October 8, 2024)</strong>: The landlord sent a second notice of termination, citing a failure to maintain insurance (Section 15) and restricted hours of operation (Section 7), in addition to non-payment of rent. The lease is considered terminated as of November 9, 2024.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Earlier Communications (September 2024)</strong>: In a text exchange, Debbie, representing the landlord, initially waived the late fee for September, showing a prior agreement to provide flexibility in rent payments.</ol></li>

<h3>Key Points from the Lease (Dated May 26, 2020):</h3>
<ul>- <strong>Section 24 (Tenant's Default)</strong>: This section grants you 10 business days after receiving written notice to cure any default in rent payments. 
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 36 (Notices)</strong>: Official notices must be delivered via certified mail, registered mail, or a recognized courier service.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 7(b) (Restricted Hours of Operation)</strong>: The lease specifies operating hours that, if violated, may lead to automatic termination.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 15 (Insurance)</strong>: Tenant must maintain liability and liquor liability insurance.</ul></li>

<h3>Questions to Clarify Next Steps:</h3>
<ol>1. Have you provided evidence of compliance with the insurance requirements in Section 15 of the lease?
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Were there any prior warnings or issues raised about restricted hours of operation before the October 8 termination notice?</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Do you have proof or records showing your payment attempts on or before the due date mentioned in the "Notice to Pay or Quit"?</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">What are your intended next steps to contest the termination, considering the landlord's notice on November 9?</ol></li>

These questions will help focus on how to address the issues raised in the termination notice.</div>

                            <div class="message-text">I have yet to provide evidence of compliance with the insurance requirements in section 15 of the lease, but I can and will today. There have been ZERO warnings or issues raised about the restricted hours of operation before the October 8th termination notice. Additionally, our posted hours of operation comply with the lease stipulations. I only have the text messages between Matt stickler and myself and logan and myself, informing them I was able and trying to pay rent. I guess I could show proof of withdrawing the cash from my bank accounts. 

I don’t know my next steps or options. Which is why im asking you. </div>

                            <div class="message-text">Thank you for sharing these important details. Here are some potential next steps and considerations to address the situation:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Provide Proof of Compliance with Insurance Requirements (Section 15)</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Since you can demonstrate compliance with insurance requirements, send this evidence to the landlord as soon as possible. Ensure this is done via certified mail, as required by the lease (Section 36), and document everything.</ul>
<ol>   
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Refute the Alleged Violation of Hours of Operation (Section 7)</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Since no prior warnings or issues were raised and you are operating within the lease-stipulated hours, gather any documentation that shows your compliance (e.g., publicly posted hours, receipts, or employee schedules). Include this in a formal response to the landlord, reiterating that there has been no breach in this area.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Document Payment Efforts</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Provide proof of your efforts to pay rent on time (e.g., text messages and, if possible, bank withdrawal records). Emphasize that you tried to comply with the payment timeline in the "Notice to Pay or Quit" but were not able to deliver the payment due to the landlord’s representative being unavailable.</ul>
<ol>   
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Prepare a Legal Response</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Draft a formal response to the landlord refuting the termination of the lease. This should include:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Evidence of compliance with insurance and hours of operation.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Documentation of your attempts to make the rent payment and how their failure to accept the payment caused delay.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A request to retract the termination notice based on these facts.</ul></li>
<ol>   
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Consider Legal Assistance</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Given the complexity of the situation and the potential for the landlord to continue with eviction proceedings, consulting with a lawyer may be beneficial. A legal professional can help ensure that your rights under the lease are fully protected and that any further steps comply with West Virginia law.</ul>

<strong>From:</strong>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Event of Default and Lease Termination</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your recent notices, specifically the <em>Notice of Event of Default</em> dated October 1, 2024, and the <em>Notice of Lease Termination</em> dated October 8, 2024.

<h3>1. <strong>Compliance with Insurance Requirements</strong>  </h3>
As per the lease agreement, specifically Section 15, I am providing evidence of compliance with the insurance requirements. I have enclosed the relevant insurance certificates demonstrating that NAVI Inc. has maintained the required commercial general liability and liquor liability insurance policies. This documentation confirms that NAVI Inc. has met all insurance obligations under the lease, and I request that this issue be considered resolved.

<h3>2. <strong>Refutation of Alleged Violation of Hours of Operation</strong>  </h3>
There have been no prior warnings or issues raised concerning our hours of operation. Our posted hours of operation fully comply with Section 7(b) of the lease, and there has been no violation of this provision. I would appreciate it if you could provide any specific incidents that are being referenced in the notice dated October 8, 2024, as this claim appears to be unfounded.

<h3>3. <strong>Payment Efforts and Rent Compliance</strong>  </h3>
Regarding the Notice to Pay or Quit dated September 25, 2024, I made documented efforts to pay the rent in full within the specified timeframe. Attached are copies of my communications with Matt Stickler and Logan, informing them that I had secured the necessary funds and was attempting to make the payment by the due date. Unfortunately, due to the landlord's representative being unavailable to accept payment at the time, I was unable to deliver the funds despite having them ready.

In light of this, I request that this payment issue be reconsidered, as I acted in good faith to meet the deadline. Additionally, I am prepared to provide proof of withdrawal from my bank account to further support my position.

<h3>4. <strong>Section 24: Right to Cure</strong>  </h3>
Under Section 24 of the lease agreement, I am entitled to a 10-business-day period to cure any default after receiving written notice. The Notice to Pay or Quit was delivered on September 25, 2024, and the Notice of Default was issued on October 1, 2024. Therefore, I was still within the allowable cure period at the time the default notice was issued. Issuing the default notice during the cure period is a violation of the lease agreement, and I request that this issue be rectified.

<h3>5. <strong>Delivery of Notices (Section 36)</strong>  </h3>
Furthermore, the lease agreement in Section 36 requires that all notices related to default be delivered via certified or registered mail. The September 25, 2024 notice was not delivered in compliance with this provision. Therefore, the termination notice based on this default is premature and invalid, as proper procedure was not followed.

<h3><strong>Conclusion and Request for Retraction</strong>  </h3>
In light of the above, I respectfully request that you retract the <em>Notice of Lease Termination</em> dated October 8, 2024, and allow me the proper time under the lease to resolve any outstanding issues. I remain committed to fulfilling NAVI Inc.'s obligations under the lease and seek to resolve this matter amicably and in accordance with the terms set forth in our agreement.

I look forward to your prompt confirmation that the notices have been retracted and that NAVI Inc. will be allowed to continue occupancy under the terms of the lease.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you require any additional information or documentation.

Sincerely,  
<strong>Christopher Craven</strong>  
President, NAVI Inc.

                            <div class="message-text">If the landlord does not retract the notice after receiving your formal response, here are several possible next steps you can take:

<h3>1. <strong>Landlord’s Response or Continued Action</strong>:</h3>
<ul>   - If the landlord refuses to retract the notice, they may proceed with <strong>eviction proceedings</strong>. In West Virginia, this typically involves filing for a <strong>forcible entry and detainer</strong> action in court to remove you from the premises.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You will receive a <strong>summons</strong> to appear in court. This is your opportunity to present your case, demonstrating your compliance with the lease (e.g., insurance, payment attempts, adherence to hours of operation).</ul></li>

<h3>2. <strong>Legal Response in Court</strong>:</h3>
<ul>   - If the landlord files for eviction, you will need to <strong>respond to the court</strong>. This is where your formal letter, evidence of compliance, and proof of good-faith payment attempts will be critical.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You may argue that:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The landlord failed to follow proper procedure (e.g., issuing notices during the cure period).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The landlord's allegations (regarding restricted hours or insurance) are unfounded.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You made legitimate efforts to pay the rent but were hindered by their representatives.</ul></li>

<h3>3. <strong>Court Mediation or Hearing</strong>:</h3>
<ul>   - Courts often encourage <strong>settlement or mediation</strong>. At this stage, both parties may be encouraged to come to a mutual agreement to avoid a drawn-out court process.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You can propose to settle by paying any outstanding rent, resolving any disputes, or clarifying misunderstandings (such as the hours of operation).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">If a settlement isn’t reached, the judge will review the case and evidence from both sides to make a ruling.</ul></li>

<h3>4. <strong>Potential Outcomes</strong>:</h3>
<ul>   - <strong>If you win</strong>: The judge may rule that the landlord acted improperly in issuing the default and termination notices. You may be allowed to stay in the premises, provided you continue meeting your obligations (such as paying any remaining rent).
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>If the landlord wins</strong>: The court could issue an <strong>eviction order</strong>, requiring you to vacate the premises by a certain date. You may still be liable for any unpaid rent, fees, or other lease obligations through the end of the lease term.</ul></li>

<h3>5. <strong>Consider Seeking Legal Representation</strong>:</h3>
<ul>   - If the landlord proceeds with eviction or refuses to retract the notice, consulting an attorney experienced in landlord-tenant disputes would be highly advisable.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A lawyer can represent you in court, help negotiate with the landlord, and ensure that your rights under the lease and state law are protected.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">An attorney might also be able to file an <strong>injunction</strong> to temporarily halt any eviction process if the landlord is acting improperly.</ul></li>

<h3>6. <strong>Keep Detailed Records</strong>:</h3>
<ul>   - Ensure you keep copies of all communications, including proof of mailing your response and any further correspondence from the landlord. These documents could be critical in court to demonstrate your good-faith efforts and compliance with the lease.</ul>

<h3>In Summary:</h3>
After sending the formal response, you may either negotiate directly with the landlord or prepare for potential court action. If the landlord proceeds with eviction, you will have the opportunity to present your case, including your letter, communications, and compliance documentation.

                            <div class="message-text">An <strong>injunction</strong> is a court order that requires a party to do or refrain from doing a specific action. In the context of a landlord-tenant dispute, a <strong>tenant injunction</strong> might be used to temporarily stop eviction proceedings or other actions that the landlord is taking, particularly if the tenant believes that the landlord is acting improperly or in violation of the lease or the law.

<h3>Types of Injunctions:</h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)</strong>:</ol>
<ul>   - This is a short-term, emergency injunction used to stop immediate harm, such as eviction or actions to remove the tenant from the premises.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A TRO is typically granted very quickly, sometimes without the other party being present, and only lasts for a short time (usually 10-14 days).</ul></li>
<ol>   
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Preliminary Injunction</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - This type of injunction is granted after a court hearing, where both parties present their arguments. It lasts for the duration of the legal proceedings, preventing any actions (such as eviction) until the court has made a final decision on the dispute.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Permanent Injunction</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - This is a final ruling by the court that may be issued after the case has been fully heard and decided. A permanent injunction could require the landlord to cease specific actions for the remainder of the lease term.</ul>

<h3>Grounds for Filing an Injunction in a Tenant-Landlord Case:</h3>
You may seek an injunction if:
<ul>- The landlord is attempting to evict you <strong>unlawfully</strong> or without following proper procedures.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The landlord is <strong>violating the terms of the lease</strong> (e.g., not allowing you to cure the default as provided in the lease).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You are at risk of <strong>irreparable harm</strong>, such as being evicted without a proper legal process, and money damages wouldn't be sufficient to fix the problem.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You are complying with your obligations and the landlord is acting in <strong>bad faith</strong> (e.g., refusing payments, not honoring previously waived fees).</ul></li>

<h3>Filing an Injunction:</h3>
The process of filing an injunction can vary slightly by jurisdiction, but the basic steps include:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Consult with an Attorney (Optional but Recommended)</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Although it's possible to file for an injunction without an attorney (pro se), it can be legally complex, and an attorney can ensure that the filing meets all legal requirements.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">An attorney can also help you prepare the necessary evidence and legal arguments to persuade the judge.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>File a Petition or Motion for an Injunction</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - This document will need to outline your reasons for seeking the injunction. It typically includes:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A <strong>description of the harm</strong> you will suffer if the injunction isn’t granted.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Evidence</strong> that shows why the landlord's actions are improper (e.g., violation of lease terms, improper notice, or refusal to accept payment).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Legal arguments</strong> that show you are likely to succeed in the underlying dispute (e.g., improper eviction notice, failure to comply with the lease).</ul></li>
<ol>   
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Submit an Affidavit</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - An affidavit is a sworn statement that supports your petition, detailing the facts of the case. This should include:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The timeline of events.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Documentation (such as emails, notices, and texts) supporting your claims.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A clear description of why the landlord's actions are unlawful and why immediate court intervention is necessary.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Request a Temporary Restraining Order (Optional)</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - If the situation is urgent (e.g., the landlord is moving forward with eviction), you can request a <strong>TRO</strong> to stop the landlord from acting until the court can hold a hearing. A TRO may be granted very quickly, sometimes on the same day.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>File with the Court and Serve the Landlord</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Once the petition is completed, you need to file it with the appropriate court. In a landlord-tenant dispute, this is typically the <strong>civil or housing court</strong> in your jurisdiction.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">After filing, the landlord must be <strong>served</strong> with the court papers (i.e., they must receive notice of the injunction request).</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Attend the Hearing</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - The court will schedule a hearing for a <strong>preliminary injunction</strong>. Both you and the landlord will have the opportunity to present your arguments.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">At this stage, you will need to present your evidence and legal argument as to why the injunction should be granted.</ul></li>

<h3>Requirements for the Court to Grant an Injunction:</h3>
To succeed in obtaining an injunction, you will typically need to demonstrate:
<ul>- <strong>Likelihood of success on the merits</strong>: You must show that your case is likely to succeed (e.g., the landlord failed to follow lease provisions or the law).
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Irreparable harm</strong>: You must demonstrate that without the injunction, you will suffer harm that cannot be fixed by later compensation (e.g., losing your business space).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Balance of harms</strong>: The court will weigh whether granting the injunction would cause more harm to the landlord than the harm you would suffer if it’s not granted.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Public interest</strong>: The court may consider whether granting the injunction aligns with public policy or benefits society (e.g., preventing unlawful eviction).</ul></li>

<h3>Practical Steps:</h3>
<ul>- <strong>Gather Evidence</strong>: Make sure you have all supporting documentation such as the lease, notices, texts, emails, and proof of payment attempts.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Consult Local Court Rules</strong>: Every jurisdiction has specific rules and forms for injunction filings. Visit your local courthouse or check their website for instructions and forms specific to your jurisdiction.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Seek Mediation</strong>: Some courts will require you to attempt mediation before filing for an injunction, especially in housing disputes.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
Filing for an injunction can protect your rights by halting the landlord's actions while you resolve the dispute. However, this is a legal procedure that requires careful preparation and supporting evidence. If you believe you have a strong case and the landlord’s actions are improper, pursuing an injunction may be a way to prevent eviction and protect your business during the dispute.

v.  
DBG Properties LLC,  
Defendant.

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3>PETITION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</h3>

<strong>Introduction</strong>  
Plaintiff, Christopher Craven, President of NAVI Inc., respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction against Defendant, DBG Properties LLC, to prevent the unlawful termination of the lease agreement and eviction from the premises located at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, West Virginia. Plaintiff seeks this relief to maintain the status quo and avoid irreparable harm until the merits of this dispute are fully resolved.

<strong>Statement of Facts</strong>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Lease Agreement</strong>: On May 26, 2020, NAVI Inc. entered into a lease agreement with DBG Properties LLC for commercial premises located at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, West Virginia, for a term of five years.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notice to Pay or Quit</strong>: On September 25, 2024, Defendant issued a Notice to Pay or Quit, demanding payment of $4,600 within five days. This notice failed to comply with the lease, as Section 24 provides Plaintiff with ten (10) business days to cure any default.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Efforts to Pay</strong>: Plaintiff made multiple attempts to deliver the rent payment within the specified period but was prevented from doing so by Defendant’s representatives. Despite good faith efforts, the rent payment was not accepted.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notice of Default</strong>: On October 1, 2024, Defendant issued a Notice of Event of Default and Lease Termination before the cure period expired, in direct violation of Section 24 of the lease agreement.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notice of Lease Termination</strong>: On October 8, 2024, Defendant issued a new notice of termination citing additional lease violations, including failure to maintain insurance and restricted hours of operation, both of which Plaintiff has complied with fully.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Immediate Harm</strong>: Plaintiff risks eviction and irreparable harm to the business if the court does not intervene. The loss of the premises would significantly damage Plaintiff’s ability to continue operations, causing reputational and financial harm that cannot be remedied by monetary compensation.</ol></li>

<strong>Legal Grounds for Injunction</strong>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Breach of Lease Agreement</strong>: Defendant has failed to honor the provisions of the lease agreement by not providing the required time to cure any defaults and by not following the notice procedures outlined in Section 36.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Irreparable Harm</strong>: Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm through loss of the premises, inability to maintain business operations, and damage to Plaintiff’s financial and business reputation, for which monetary compensation is insufficient.</ol></li>

<strong>Request for Relief</strong>

Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court to:
<ol>1. Issue a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent Defendant from proceeding with any eviction actions or further attempts to terminate the lease agreement.
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Issue a Preliminary Injunction enjoining Defendant from taking any further action to terminate the lease or remove Plaintiff from the premises until this matter is fully resolved.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6">Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.</ol></li>

will not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition on any subsequent breach of the same or any
other term, covenant or condition herein contained. The subsequent acceptance of Rent by Landlord will not be deemed
to be a waiver of any preceding breach by Tenant of any tenn, covenant or condition of this Lease, regardless of

signed by the party to be bound thereby.”</div>

                            <div class="message-text">This section is a <strong>non-waiver clause</strong> designed to protect both the landlord and tenant from inadvertently losing their rights under the lease, even if they have not strictly enforced certain provisions in the past. Here’s a breakdown of what it means:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Waiver of Breach</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - If either party (landlord or tenant) allows the other to break a term of the lease without immediately enforcing their rights (e.g., by taking action to remedy the breach), this does <strong>not mean</strong> they permanently lose their right to enforce that term in the future.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">For example, if the landlord allows you to pay rent late once or even multiple times without consequence, this does not mean they are giving up their right to insist on timely rent payments in the future.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Acceptance of Rent</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - If the landlord accepts rent from the tenant, it does <strong>not mean</strong> that they are forgiving any prior breaches of the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">For example, if you breached the lease by not maintaining insurance, and the landlord later accepts a rent payment from you, that <strong>doesn’t waive</strong> their right to enforce the insurance requirement or claim a breach occurred previously.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>No Waiver Without Written Agreement</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - This part clarifies that no term, covenant, or condition of the lease can be waived (i.e., given up) unless it is done in <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>signed</strong> by the party that would be bound by that waiver.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">For example, if the landlord agrees to waive a late fee or any breach, it must be in writing. If it's not, the landlord could later claim the breach is still valid.</ul></li>

<h3>What This Means for You:</h3>
<ul>- Even if the landlord waived the late fee in the past (as indicated in your communication with Debbie), this clause suggests that such a waiver only applies to that specific instance. It <strong>does not</strong> mean the landlord will waive future late fees unless it is explicitly agreed upon in writing.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Similarly, just because the landlord accepted rent after a potential breach doesn’t mean they are waiving their right to claim that a breach of the lease has occurred.</ul></li>

This clause essentially protects both parties from accidentally giving up their legal rights or being assumed to have waived a breach unless it’s done formally in writing.

Would you like further clarification on how this might affect your current situation?</div>
                        </div>

                            <div class="message-text">Yes i would. Because this does not sound favorable to me. Basically you’re saying that they can go back and count other instances of rent being late towards the clause related to trying to terminate the lease?</div>
                        </div>

                            <div class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Assistant</div>
                            <div class="message-text">Yes, that's essentially correct, and it's why the <strong>non-waiver clause</strong> can seem unfavorable from the tenant's perspective. Here's why:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Past Acceptance of Late Rent</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Even if the landlord previously accepted late rent without penalty, this <strong>non-waiver clause</strong> allows the landlord to <strong>still count those past late payments</strong> as breaches if they choose to later enforce the lease strictly. 
<li class="list-disc ml-6">For example, they could claim that your prior late payments, even if forgiven at the time, contribute to a pattern of non-compliance, which could potentially lead to terminating the lease under the "repeated default" provision (such as in Section 24).</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>No Forgiveness Without Written Waiver</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - If the landlord didn’t explicitly <strong>waive the breach in writing</strong>, they can argue that they reserved the right to enforce the lease at a later date, despite having previously accepted rent late without immediate action.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">In your situation, even though Debbie waived a late fee previously, unless this waiver was in <strong>writing</strong> and clearly tied to future obligations, the landlord could still use past late payments as grounds to assert a pattern of default.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Risk of Lease Termination for Repeated Defaults</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Section 24 of your lease likely contains a provision where the landlord can seek to terminate the lease for repeated breaches (e.g., multiple late payments). This non-waiver clause makes it possible for the landlord to argue that while they may not have enforced the lease immediately after each late payment, those late payments still contribute to a pattern of non-compliance.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">As a result, they might attempt to terminate the lease now by referring to those past late payments.</ul></li>

<h3>How This Affects You:</h3>
<ul>- The landlord may use this <strong>non-waiver clause</strong> to count previous late payments or other minor breaches, even if those breaches seemed to be "forgiven" at the time (e.g., no immediate action was taken, or rent was accepted late).
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Even though Debbie waived a late fee once, unless that waiver was formalized in writing, they could still argue that late rent constitutes a breach.</ul></li>

<h3>Possible Defenses or Responses:</h3>
<ol>1. <strong>Good-Faith Effort</strong>: You’ve made good-faith efforts to comply with the lease, including communication about payment issues. If the landlord refused your rent when you tried to pay, you could argue this was unreasonable and outside the lease terms.
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Estoppel Argument</strong>: You could potentially argue that the landlord’s prior <strong>consistent acceptance of late rent</strong> without penalty (if it happened repeatedly) established a <strong>pattern of behavior</strong> that would make it unfair for them to suddenly enforce it strictly now without clear warning. This is known as an estoppel defense, where the landlord’s previous actions effectively prevent them from enforcing those terms strictly retroactively.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Challenge the Timeliness of Notices</strong>: If you’ve been given insufficient notice or improper delivery of the default and termination notices (as per Sections 24 and 36), this could also be a defense to challenge the landlord's current attempt to terminate the lease.</ol></li>

<h3>Next Steps:</h3>
<ul>- You may want to <strong>gather documentation</strong> of all prior late payments and any communications where the landlord accepted late rent without issue.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">If this goes to court, these documents may help establish that the landlord previously <strong>accepted late rent without consequence</strong>, which might support an estoppel defense.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Additionally, if the landlord is basing their termination on repeated defaults but <strong>never formally warned</strong> you about past late payments in writing, this could weaken their argument for termination.</ul></li>

                            <div class="message-text">Yes, the lease does require <strong>written notice</strong> for the termination of the lease due to repeated defaults. Specifically, under Section 24(f) of your lease, it states that if a tenant repeats a default twice in any 12-month period, any similar default within the same 12-month period will be considered a "repeated default." In the event of a repeated default, <strong>the landlord is required to provide prior written notice</strong> to the tenant before terminating the lease.

This means that, even in cases of repeated default, the landlord cannot terminate the lease immediately without first issuing written notice to you. This notice must comply with the methods specified under <strong>Section 36 (Notices)</strong> of the lease, which requires that any official communication (including notices of default or termination) must be sent via <strong>certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested</strong>, or by a recognized courier service.

Thus, if the landlord attempts to terminate the lease based on "repeated defaults," but has not provided written notice using the methods specified in the lease, you can challenge the termination as procedurally improper.

                            <div class="message-text">You're correct in identifying the tension between two sections of the lease: 
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Non-Waiver Clause (Section 23)</strong>: This allows the landlord to count previous late payments towards a "repeated default" claim, even if they accepted rent late in the past without formally addressing the default at the time.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notice Requirements for Default and Termination (Section 24 and 36)</strong>: These sections require the landlord to provide written notice of defaults and follow specific procedures for delivering those notices (via certified or registered mail, etc.). They also outline your right to a cure period for defaults.</ol></li>

<h3>The Key Issue:</h3>
The landlord is trying to terminate the lease for "repeated defaults" (i.e., more than two late payments in a 12-month period), but <strong>they did not send written notices</strong> documenting these prior late payments as defaults when they occurred.

<h3>Which Clause Prevails?</h3>

<strong>Notice Requirements (Section 24 & 36) are Critical:</strong>
<ul>- <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of the lease specifically states that after two defaults in a 12-month period, the landlord can declare any further default a "repeated default." However, <strong>before terminating the lease</strong>, the landlord <strong>must give you written notice</strong> of the "repeated default" and an opportunity to cure. 
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The <strong>non-waiver clause (Section 23)</strong> lets the landlord <em>potentially cite</em> previous breaches (e.g., late rent) even if they didn’t enforce the lease strictly at the time, but it <strong>does not override the requirement for written notice</strong> of default and an opportunity to cure under <strong>Section 24</strong>.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
For the landlord to terminate the lease for "repeated defaults," they must have followed the <strong>notice procedure</strong> required under <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> for each default. If they failed to formally notify you of each prior late payment as a default at the time, then their ability to claim "repeated default" is weakened.

In your case:
<ul>- If the landlord is now citing prior late payments as part of a "repeated default" claim but <strong>did not issue formal written notices for those defaults</strong>, they cannot retroactively use those prior instances as grounds for termination.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The <strong>written notice requirement</strong> (Section 24 and 36) overrules their ability to simply rely on past defaults unless they properly documented those defaults in compliance with the lease's procedures.</ul></li>

<h3>Your Defense:</h3>
<ul>- You can argue that while late rent payments may have occurred, the landlord did <strong>not provide proper written notice</strong> of default at the time, and therefore, they cannot now terminate the lease on the grounds of "repeated default."</ul>

<h3>On Unintentional Breaches:</h3>
<ul>- According to <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of your lease, for breaches <strong>other than non-payment of rent</strong> (such as operating the business improperly), you are typically entitled to <strong>30 days written notice</strong> to correct the issue before the landlord can terminate the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">This means that even if the landlord claims you are breaching the lease by operating as a bar, they would be required to provide written notice and give you the opportunity to <strong>rectify the breach within 30 days</strong>, unless the breach cannot be cured or corrected within that time frame.</ul></li>

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing to formally respond to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, and to address various claims made regarding rent payment, alleged breaches of lease terms, and the operation of our businesses under the lease.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of “Repeated Default”</strong>  </h3>
Regarding the claim of “repeated default” based on late rent payments, I acknowledge that rent payments have been late on six occasions in the past 12 months. However, <strong>no written notice</strong> was ever issued to me by DBG Properties LLC for any of these late payments, as required under <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of the lease. While I have always paid the corresponding late fees in good faith, there has been <strong>no formal written documentation</strong> of these defaults as mandated under <strong>Section 36</strong>.

Under the lease’s non-waiver provision (<strong>Section 23</strong>), the acceptance of late rent does not waive the landlord's right to enforce timely payments in the future, but the lease <strong>still requires written notice of each breach</strong> before the landlord can invoke a claim of repeated default. Since no such notices were provided, citing these past payments to justify lease termination is procedurally improper.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September Rent Payment</strong>  </h3>
In response to the <em>Notice to Pay or Quit</em> dated September 25, 2024, I made several documented attempts to deliver the rent within the prescribed period. However, these efforts were hindered when your representatives were unavailable to accept payment, despite my communication showing intent and readiness to comply.

Furthermore, <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> provides me with a 10-business-day cure period after written notice of default is given. I was still within this period when the <em>Notice of Default</em> was issued on October 1, 2024, violating the terms of the lease.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro and The Cellar Door</strong>  </h3>
You have also insinuated that my businesses, Le Bistro and The Cellar Door, are being operated as bars, in breach of the lease. I want to clarify that <strong>both entities are DBAs under Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, and operate under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease agreement. The primary use of the premises remains a restaurant, in compliance with the permitted use stipulated under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease. The service of alcohol by the glass is in strict accordance with the terms of the lease, and there has been no violation of any restricted hours of operation or unauthorized use of the premises.

To date, I have received <strong>no prior written notice</strong> of any alleged breach in this regard. <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> requires the landlord to provide 30 days written notice to cure any breach unrelated to rent, which has not been provided in this case.

<h3>4. <strong>Compliance with Insurance Requirements</strong>  </h3>
Regarding the alleged failure to maintain the required insurance, I have attached proof of current and compliant insurance coverage, as required under <strong>Section 15</strong> of the lease. This issue should be considered resolved, and there are no outstanding defaults on this front.

<h3>5. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong>  </h3>
In light of the above, I respectfully request that you retract the Notice of Lease Termination issued on October 8, 2024, on the grounds that:
<ul>   - There has been <strong>no proper written notice</strong> for the alleged “repeated default” as required under the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">I have complied with all operational provisions, and no formal notice of any alleged breach regarding use of the premises has been issued.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">There has been <strong>no violation of hours of operation</strong>, and I have provided proof of compliance with the insurance requirements.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion  </h3>
I remain committed to fulfilling my obligations under the lease and wish to resolve this matter amicably and in good faith. I trust that this response clarifies the inaccuracies in the termination notice and confirms my continued compliance with the terms of the lease. I request your prompt confirmation that the notice has been retracted.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you require any further clarification or documentation.

I do not understand why, but it seems like an attempt to force a breech of the lease. 

Also, I want it to be clear that while we turn our open sign off at the posted closing times, and no not take new guests, we do allow the guests that are already in house to remain in house and continue spending money until they want to leave (essentially finishing the experience with us they began before the end of business operational hours). </div>

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, and to address several inaccuracies and procedural issues raised in relation to rent payments, the operation of Le Bistro and The Cellar Door, and compliance with the terms of our lease agreement.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of “Repeated Default”</strong>  </h3>
Regarding the claim of “repeated default” based on late rent payments, I acknowledge that on six occasions in the past 12 months, rent has been paid after the 5th day of the month. However, <strong>no written notices</strong> were ever issued documenting these defaults as required under <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> of the lease. While I have consistently paid late fees where applicable, the lease requires that formal written notice be provided to document any defaults before they can be cited for “repeated default.”

Without proper notice of these alleged defaults, the claim of repeated default, as referenced in your Notice of Lease Termination, is procedurally improper.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong>  </h3>
I made every effort to pay both September and October rent within the lease terms, but was actively <strong>prevented</strong> from doing so. Specifically:
<ul>   - I attempted to pay October rent on the Friday before October 5th, but no one from the management team was available to accept the payment.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">On the following Monday (October 7, 2024), my manager attempted to pay both September and October rent in cash to the secretary at the management office. However, she was instructed, by phone, <strong>not to accept the rent</strong>. No explanation was given for this refusal, and I believe this action was taken in bad faith, potentially in an attempt to force a breach of the lease.</ul></li>

I want to reiterate that I have consistently made good-faith efforts to comply with my rent obligations, and the failure to accept these payments is entirely beyond my control.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro and The Cellar Door</strong>  </h3>
Your notice has also inaccurately claimed that my businesses are operating as bars, in breach of the lease. I want to clarify that both <strong>Le Bistro</strong> and <strong>The Cellar Door</strong> are DBAs (Doing Business As) under <strong>Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, and we operate under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease. The permitted use of the premises as a restaurant, as stipulated under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, has not been violated.

While we turn off our "open" sign at the posted closing times and do not seat new guests after that time, we allow patrons already inside to finish their meals and continue spending as part of their dining experience. This is standard practice in the hospitality industry and is in no way a violation of the lease. 

To date, <strong>no written notice</strong> has been provided by DBG Properties LLC indicating that our operating procedures are in breach of the lease, as would be required under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>. Should there be any concerns regarding the operation of the premises, I would have appreciated the opportunity to address them within the 30-day cure period specified by the lease.

<h3>4. <strong>Compliance with Insurance Requirements</strong>  </h3>
Regarding the claim of non-compliance with insurance requirements, I have attached proof of our current insurance policies, including the required general liability and liquor liability coverage, in accordance with <strong>Section 15</strong> of the lease. There are no unresolved defaults related to insurance.

<h3>5. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong>  </h3>
In light of the above, I request that you retract the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, on the following grounds:
<ul>   - There has been <strong>no proper written notice</strong> regarding the alleged “repeated defaults,” as required under the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">I have made multiple good-faith attempts to pay rent on time, and the failure to accept these payments was beyond my control.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">There has been <strong>no violation of the hours of operation</strong> or use of the premises in breach of the lease, and no written notice of any operational violations has been provided.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">I have provided proof of compliance with the lease's insurance requirements.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion  </h3>
I remain fully committed to meeting my obligations under the lease and wish to resolve any misunderstandings in a cooperative manner. Given the procedural and factual errors outlined in this letter, I request that the termination notice be retracted, and that we move forward in good faith.

Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the Notice of Lease Termination. Should you require any additional information or documentation, feel free to reach out to me directly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing to formally respond to your Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. There are several critical inaccuracies and procedural issues regarding alleged rent payment defaults, operational compliance, and the recent lapse in insurance coverage. I would like to clarify these issues in light of the relevant provisions of our lease agreement.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of "Repeated Default"</strong></h3>
You have cited "repeated default" as grounds for lease termination based on alleged late rent payments. While I acknowledge that rent has been paid late on six occasions in the past 12 months, it is essential to note that <strong>no formal written notice</strong> of these defaults was provided at the time of occurrence, as required under the lease.

Specifically, <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> of the lease states that in the event of a rent payment default, the tenant is entitled to <strong>"ten (10) business days after written notice from the Landlord of such failure to pay when due"</strong> to cure the default. Furthermore, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> addresses repeated defaults, stating that if a tenant fails to pay rent or other charges twice within any 12-month period, any further similar default within the same period will be deemed a repeated default. However, the lease still requires the landlord to provide prior <strong>"written notice"</strong> of such defaults and a right to cure.

Since <strong>no written notice</strong> was provided documenting these prior late payments as defaults, the claim of "repeated default" cannot be supported in compliance with the lease’s notice requirements.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong></h3>
I made multiple <strong>good-faith efforts</strong> to pay both September and October rent on time. Specifically:
<ul>- On the Friday before the October 5th deadline, I attempted to pay rent, but no one from management was available to accept it.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">On Monday, October 7, my manager attempted to pay both September and October rent at the management office. However, your office secretary, after making a phone call, <strong>refused to accept the payment</strong>, without explanation. </ul></li>

This refusal prevented me from curing the alleged rent default, despite my timely attempts. This appears to be an attempt to <strong>force a breach</strong>, which I view as being in bad faith. Per <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>, I should have been allowed 10 business days to cure the default, and you prevented me from doing so by refusing to accept the rent.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro and The Cellar Door</strong></h3>
You have also suggested that Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are operating as bars, which would violate <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, which prohibits operation as a bar. However, this claim is inaccurate. Both Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are DBAs under <strong>Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, operating under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease.

We fully comply with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong> of the lease, which states:  
<strong>"Tenant shall use and occupy the Premises as a restaurant (the 'Permitted Use')."</strong>  
The lease further allows for the service of alcoholic beverages as part of the restaurant service, which is precisely how we operate. 

Additionally, regarding hours of operation, while we turn off the "open" sign at the posted closing times, we allow guests already in the establishment to finish their dining experience. This is common practice and does not constitute a violation of the lease. I have received <strong>no formal written notice</strong> of any such breach, as would be required under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>, which provides a <strong>30-day period</strong> to cure any breach related to operational issues.

<h3>4. <strong>Insurance Lapse and Rectification</strong></h3>
Regarding the insurance lapse, while one of the required insurance policies briefly lapsed due to an issue with a closed bank account, this has been fully resolved. The lapse occurred because of a fraud incident that forced us to close the bank account tied to our insurance payments. We immediately rectified the situation and transferred our other two policies to the new account, but the third policy inadvertently lapsed.

Despite this, the lease clearly states in <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> that in the event of a breach not related to rent payment (including an insurance lapse), I am entitled to <strong>"thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Landlord to Tenant"</strong> to cure the breach.  
No such written notice was provided to allow me the opportunity to cure this issue, and the problem has already been resolved. Therefore, the insurance lapse cannot serve as grounds for immediate lease termination.

<h3>5. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong></h3>
Considering the procedural errors mentioned above, I request that the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, be retracted on the following grounds:
<ul>- The alleged "repeated defaults" were not properly documented with <strong>written notice</strong>, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong>.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">My multiple attempts to pay September and October rent were <strong>wrongfully refused</strong>, preventing me from curing the default.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">There has been <strong>no violation of hours of operation</strong> or use of the premises in breach of <strong>Section 7</strong>, and no written notice has been provided to address any such issues.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse was a minor and unintentional breach that has been cured, and I was not provided with the <strong>required 30-day notice</strong> to remedy the issue before termination, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
I remain committed to fulfilling all of my obligations under the lease and hope to resolve any misunderstandings in a cooperative manner. I respectfully request that you retract the Notice of Lease Termination and confirm that Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc. will be allowed to continue its occupancy under the lease’s terms.

Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the Notice of Lease Termination. Should you require any additional information, I am available to provide further documentation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

                            <div class="message-text">Certainly! Including the legal distinction between a restaurant and a bar in West Virginia can help clarify that your businesses (Le Bistro and The Cellar Door) are operating as restaurants and not as bars. Here’s an overview of the distinction you can use, based on West Virginia state laws:

<h3>West Virginia Legal Distinction Between a Restaurant and a Bar:</h3>
Under West Virginia law, the primary distinction between a <strong>restaurant</strong> and a <strong>bar</strong> involves the <strong>percentage of food sales</strong> versus alcohol sales and the nature of the establishment's service. According to the <strong>West Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Commission (WVABCA)</strong>:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A <strong>restaurant</strong> is generally defined as an establishment where <strong>food is the primary service</strong>, with alcohol sales being <strong>secondary</strong>.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A <strong>bar</strong>, by contrast, is an establishment where the <strong>primary business is the sale of alcoholic beverages</strong>, and food service may be limited or nonexistent.</ul></li>

West Virginia Code §60-7-2, which governs <strong>private clubs and licenses</strong>, provides guidelines for alcohol-serving establishments. Restaurants that serve alcohol typically must meet specific requirements, such as deriving a <strong>substantial portion of their income from food sales</strong>. Restaurants in West Virginia are often required to have at least <strong>60% of total revenue</strong> coming from food, making them distinct from bars, where the majority of revenue comes from alcohol.

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. I would like to address several important issues, including inaccurate claims about the operation of Le Bistro and The Cellar Door, rent payment defaults, and the recent insurance lapse. These claims are unsupported under the relevant provisions of our lease and West Virginia state law.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of “Repeated Default”</strong></h3>
You have cited "repeated default" as grounds for terminating the lease based on alleged late rent payments. While I acknowledge that rent has been late six times in the past 12 months, <strong>no formal written notice</strong> of these defaults was ever provided, as required under <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> of the lease, which states:
 
<strong>"failure by Tenant to pay Rent within ten (10) business days after written notice from the Landlord of such failure to pay when due."</strong>

Per <strong>Section 24(f)</strong>, repeated defaults may only be claimed if they are properly documented through written notice, which was not done. Therefore, the claim of "repeated default" cannot be supported under the lease’s terms.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong></h3>
On multiple occasions, I made good-faith attempts to pay rent, including:
<ul>   - Attempting to pay October rent on the Friday before October 5th, but no one was available to accept the payment.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">On Monday, October 7, my manager attempted to pay both September and October rent in person, but the secretary was instructed not to accept the payment.</ul></li>

Under <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>, I am entitled to a <strong>10-day cure period</strong> to address any rent defaults after written notice. The refusal to accept payment, without explanation, hindered my ability to cure the alleged default and appears to have been done in bad faith.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro and The Cellar Door</strong>  </h3>
Your notice suggests that Le Bistro and The Cellar Door are operating as bars, which would violate <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease. However, this is incorrect. Both entities are DBAs of <strong>Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, and we operate under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease agreement. Our establishments fully comply with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, which stipulates:

<strong>"Tenant shall use and occupy the Premises as a restaurant (the 'Permitted Use')."</strong>

In West Virginia, the legal distinction between a <strong>restaurant</strong> and a <strong>bar</strong> is governed by state regulations, which define a restaurant as an establishment where <strong>food sales are the primary source of revenue</strong>, and alcohol sales are secondary. West Virginia Code §60-7-2 requires restaurants to generate at least <strong>60% of their revenue from food sales</strong>. Our operations consistently meet this standard, confirming that we are operating as a restaurant, not a bar.

We serve alcohol as part of our restaurant service, which is expressly permitted under the lease. Additionally, while we turn off our "open" sign at closing times and do not seat new guests, we allow existing patrons to finish their dining experience, which is standard practice in the restaurant industry and does not violate the lease.

<h3>4. <strong>Insurance Lapse and Rectification</strong></h3>
Regarding the insurance lapse, while one of the required insurance policies briefly lapsed due to a closed bank account (resulting from fraud), the issue has since been resolved. <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease provides a <strong>30-day period</strong> for me to cure non-rent-related defaults, which includes insurance issues. No such written notice was provided, yet the issue has already been rectified. Therefore, this cannot serve as grounds for termination of the lease.

<h3>5. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong></h3>
Given the procedural errors in your notice, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination be retracted. The grounds for termination—whether based on rent payment or operational issues—are unfounded and do not comply with the lease terms, as:
<ul>- <strong>No written notice</strong> of rent defaults was provided, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong>.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">I made <strong>good-faith efforts</strong> to pay rent, which were wrongfully refused.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">There is no operational breach under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, as we are in full compliance with West Virginia law governing restaurants.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The <strong>insurance lapse</strong> was an unintentional breach that has been cured, and I was not given the required <strong>30-day notice</strong> to remedy the issue.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
I remain committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and hope to resolve any misunderstandings cooperatively. I request that you retract the Notice of Lease Termination and confirm that Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc. will be allowed to continue its occupancy under the lease’s terms.

Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any additional information, I am available to provide further documentation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. I would like to address several important issues, including inaccuracies related to rent payment defaults, operational compliance, and the recent insurance lapse. These claims, as outlined in the notice, are unsupported under the relevant provisions of our lease and West Virginia state law.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of "Repeated Default"</strong></h3>
The notice cites "repeated default" based on alleged late rent payments. While I acknowledge that rent has been late on six occasions in the past 12 months, <strong>no formal written notice</strong> was ever provided documenting these defaults, as required under <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> of the lease, which states:

<strong>"failure by Tenant to pay Rent within ten (10) business days after written notice from the Landlord of such failure to pay when due."</strong>

Additionally, <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> specifies that repeated defaults may only be invoked if properly documented, stating that after two defaults, any subsequent default within a 12-month period can be considered a "repeated default." However, this is contingent upon written notice of each default, which has not been provided. As such, the claim of "repeated default" is procedurally improper.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong></h3>
I made every effort to pay both September and October rent on time, but was unable to do so due to circumstances outside my control. Specifically:
<ul>   - I attempted to pay October rent on the Friday before the October 5th deadline, but no one was available to accept the payment.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">On Monday, October 7, my manager attempted to pay both September and October rent to your office secretary, who made a phone call and was instructed <strong>not to accept the payment</strong>. No explanation was provided for this refusal, which prevented me from curing the alleged default.</ul></li>

While I do not wish to make any direct accusations, this situation could potentially be interpreted as an effort to force a default, as I was actively prevented from fulfilling my lease obligations despite making good-faith attempts.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro & The Cellar Door</strong></h3>
Your notice also implies that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is operating as a bar, in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, which prohibits such use. However, this is a mischaracterization of our operations. Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is a singular, multi-level establishment operated under <strong>Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, with each level having its own name and ambiance but operating under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease agreement.

In accordance with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, the lease permits the premises to be used as a restaurant, and the service of alcohol by the glass is expressly allowed. Per West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where <strong>food sales are the primary source of revenue</strong>, and alcohol sales are secondary. We consistently meet the legal requirement of deriving at least <strong>60% of our revenue from food sales</strong>, confirming that we are operating as a restaurant and not as a bar.

Additionally, while we adhere to posted closing times by turning off our "open" sign and ceasing to seat new guests, we do allow existing guests to finish enjoying their experience with us. This is standard practice in the industry and does not constitute a violation of the lease.

<h3>4. <strong>Insurance Lapse and Rectification</strong></h3>
Regarding the insurance lapse, one of our three required insurance policies briefly lapsed due to a closed bank account (resulting from a fraud incident). The other two policies were transferred to the new account immediately, but the third policy was overlooked. This issue has since been fully resolved.

<strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease provides a <strong>30-day period</strong> for me to cure non-rent-related breaches, including insurance lapses. I was never provided with formal written notice or an opportunity to cure this issue before it was cited as grounds for termination. Therefore, this cannot serve as a basis for immediate lease termination.

<h3>5. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong></h3>
In light of the points discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, be retracted on the following grounds:
<ul>   - The alleged "repeated defaults" were not properly documented with <strong>written notice</strong>, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> of the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">My good-faith attempts to pay rent were actively <strong>refused</strong>, preventing me from curing the alleged default.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">There has been no operational breach under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, and we are fully compliant with West Virginia law governing restaurants.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse has been cured, and no formal <strong>30-day notice</strong> was provided, as required under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
I remain committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and am hopeful we can resolve these issues cooperatively. Given the procedural and factual inaccuracies, I respectfully request that you retract the Notice of Lease Termination and confirm that Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc. will be allowed to continue its occupancy under the lease’s terms.

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. There are several important issues that need to be addressed, including inaccuracies regarding rent payment defaults, operational compliance, and a recent insurance lapse. I would like to clarify these matters in light of the relevant provisions of our lease and West Virginia state law.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of "Repeated Default"</strong></h3>
The notice of termination cites "repeated default" based on alleged late rent payments. While I acknowledge that rent has been paid late on six occasions in the past 12 months, it is important to note that <strong>no formal written notice</strong> of these defaults was provided at the time of occurrence, as required under <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> of the lease. This section states:

<strong>"failure by Tenant to pay Rent within ten (10) business days after written notice from the Landlord of such failure to pay when due."</strong>

While <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> allows the landlord to cite repeated defaults as grounds for termination after two defaults in a 12-month period, the lease is clear that these defaults must be properly documented with written notice to the tenant, giving the tenant an opportunity to cure the default. No such notices were provided for any of the past late payments. As a result, the landlord's ability to terminate the lease based on these late payments is procedurally improper.

In summary, although past late payments could be cited toward lease termination under <strong>Section 24(f)</strong>, such action is contingent on the landlord following the procedures outlined in the lease, particularly the requirement for written notice and an opportunity to cure, which were not followed in this instance.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong></h3>
I made every effort to pay both September and October rent within the timeframes set forth by the landlord, even when those deadlines deviated from the lease terms. Specifically:
<ul>   - I attempted to pay September rent by the landlord’s requested deadline of <strong>September 30, 2024</strong>, despite this not being in accordance with the lease's due date.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">On the Friday before October 5, 2024, I attempted to pay October rent, but no one was available to accept the payment.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">On Monday, October 7, my manager attempted to pay both September and October rent to your office secretary, who made a phone call and was instructed <strong>not to accept the payment</strong>. No explanation was provided for this refusal, which prevented me from curing the alleged default.</ul></li>

While I do not wish to make any direct accusations, this situation could be interpreted as an effort to force a default, as I was actively prevented from fulfilling my lease obligations despite making good-faith attempts.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro & The Cellar Door</strong></h3>
Your notice also implies that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is operating as a bar, in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, which prohibits such use. However, this is a mischaracterization of our operations. Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is a singular, multi-level establishment operated under <strong>Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, with each level having its own name and ambiance but operating under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease agreement.

In accordance with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, the lease permits the premises to be used as a restaurant, and the service of alcohol by the glass is expressly allowed. Per West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where <strong>food sales are the primary source of revenue</strong>, and alcohol sales are secondary. We consistently meet the legal requirement of deriving at least <strong>60% of our revenue from food sales</strong>, confirming that we are operating as a restaurant and not as a bar.

Additionally, while we adhere to posted closing times by turning off our "open" sign and ceasing to seat new guests, we do allow existing guests to finish enjoying their experience with us. This is standard practice in the industry and does not constitute a violation of the lease.

<h3>4. <strong>Insurance Lapse and Rectification</strong></h3>

The other two policies were transferred to the new account immediately, but the third policy was overlooked. This issue has since been fully resolved.

<strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease provides a <strong>30-day period</strong> for me to cure non-rent-related breaches, including insurance lapses. I was never provided with formal written notice or an opportunity to cure this issue before it was cited as grounds for termination. Therefore, this cannot serve as a basis for immediate lease termination.

<h3>5. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong></h3>
In light of the points discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, be retracted on the following grounds:
<ul>   - The alleged "repeated defaults" were not properly documented with <strong>written notice</strong>, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> of the lease.

Given the procedural and factual inaccuracies, I respectfully request that you retract the Notice of Lease Termination and confirm that Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc. will be allowed to continue its occupancy under the lease’s terms.

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. There are several important issues that need to be addressed, including inaccuracies regarding rent payment defaults, operational compliance, and a recent insurance lapse. I would like to clarify these matters in light of the relevant provisions of our lease and West Virginia state law.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of "Repeated Default"</strong></h3>
The notice of termination cites "repeated default" based on alleged late rent payments. While I acknowledge that rent has been paid late on six occasions in the past 12 months, it is important to note that <strong>no formal written notice</strong> of these defaults was provided at the time of occurrence, as required under <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> of the lease. This section states:

<strong>"failure by Tenant to pay Rent within ten (10) business days after written notice from the Landlord of such failure to pay when due."</strong>

While <strong>Section 24(f)</strong> allows the landlord to cite repeated defaults as grounds for termination after two defaults in a 12-month period, the lease is clear that these defaults must be properly documented with written notice to the tenant, giving the tenant an opportunity to cure the default. No such notices were provided for any of the past late payments. As a result, the landlord's ability to terminate the lease based on these late payments is procedurally improper.

In summary, although past late payments could be cited toward lease termination under <strong>Section 24(f)</strong>, such action is contingent on the landlord following the procedures outlined in the lease, particularly the requirement for written notice and an opportunity to cure, which were not followed in this instance.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong></h3>
I would like to clarify the circumstances surrounding both September and October rent payments, as follows:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text message that she would waive the late fee for September's rent. Despite this, on <strong>September 25, 2024</strong>, I received a <strong>"Pay or Quit"</strong> notice from Matt Stickler, giving me only five days to pay the full amount of $4,600 (comprising $4,000 for September rent and $600 in late fees). I attempted to pay the rent by the landlord’s requested deadline of <strong>September 30, 2024</strong>, despite the short notice and the fact that it did not align with the lease terms. I reached out via text to ask if someone was in the office to receive the payment and even offered to give it to Matt's assistant, but was informed that Logan was not authorized to accept the rent on behalf of DBG Properties. No alternative means of payment was provided at that time.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay October rent as per usual, before the 5th of the month. However, between 3:30 PM and 5:00 PM, no one was present in the office to accept payment. On the following Monday, October 7, 2024, my manager went to your office with <strong>$8,000</strong> in cash to pay both September and October rent, but the office secretary made a phone call and was instructed <strong>not to accept the payment</strong>. No reason for the refusal was provided, preventing us from curing the alleged default.</ul></li>

While I do not wish to make any direct accusations, these events could be interpreted as an effort to force a default, as I was actively prevented from fulfilling my lease obligations despite making good-faith attempts to pay rent on time.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro & The Cellar Door</strong></h3>
Your notice also implies that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is operating as a bar, in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, which prohibits such use. However, this is a mischaracterization of our operations. Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is a singular, multi-level establishment operated under <strong>Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, with each level having its own name and ambiance but operating under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease agreement.

In accordance with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, the lease permits the premises to be used as a restaurant, and the service of alcohol by the glass is expressly allowed. Per West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where <strong>food sales are the primary source of revenue</strong>, and alcohol sales are secondary. We consistently meet the legal requirement of deriving at least <strong>60% of our revenue from food sales</strong>, confirming that we are operating as a restaurant and not as a bar.

Additionally, while we adhere to posted closing times by turning off our "open" sign and ceasing to seat new guests, we do allow existing guests to finish enjoying their experience with us. This is standard practice in the industry and does not constitute a violation of the lease.

<h3>4. <strong>Insurance Lapse and Rectification</strong></h3>
Regarding the insurance lapse, one of our three required insurance policies briefly lapsed due to a closed bank account (resulting from a fraud incident). The other two policies were transferred to the new account immediately, but the third policy was overlooked. This issue has since been fully resolved.

<strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease provides a <strong>30-day period</strong> for me to cure non-rent-related breaches, including insurance lapses. I was never provided with formal written notice or an opportunity to cure this issue before it was cited as grounds for termination. Therefore, this cannot serve as a basis for immediate lease termination.

<h3>5. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong></h3>
In light of the points discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, be retracted on the following grounds:
<ul>   - The alleged "repeated defaults" were not properly documented with <strong>written notice</strong>, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> of the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">My good-faith attempts to pay rent were actively <strong>refused</strong>, preventing me from curing the alleged default.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">There has been no operational breach under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, and we are fully compliant with West Virginia law governing restaurants.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse has been cured, and no formal <strong>30-day notice</strong> was provided, as required under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
I remain committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and am hopeful we can resolve these issues cooperatively. Given the procedural and factual inaccuracies, I respectfully request that you retract the Notice of Lease Termination and confirm that Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc. will be allowed to continue its occupancy under the lease’s terms.

Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation or clarification, I am available to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. There are several important issues that need to be addressed, including inaccuracies regarding rent payment defaults, operational compliance, and a recent insurance lapse. I would like to clarify these matters in light of the relevant provisions of our lease and West Virginia state law.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of "Repeated Default"</strong></h3>
The notice of termination cites "repeated default" based on alleged late rent payments. While I acknowledge that rent has been paid late on <strong>multiple occasions</strong> in the past 12 months, it is important to clarify how this relates to the lease terms. 

<strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of the lease allows the landlord to cite prior late rent payments toward a claim of "repeated default" and potentially use them to terminate the lease. However, this right is contingent upon strict procedural requirements, as outlined in <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> of the lease. Specifically, these sections require that any such late payments be documented through <strong>written notice</strong>, giving the tenant an opportunity to cure the default within 10 business days.

In this case, no such formal written notices were provided for any of the past late payments. As a result, while prior late payments could theoretically be used to justify lease termination, the failure to follow the required notice procedures renders the claim of repeated default procedurally improper.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong></h3>
I would like to clarify the circumstances surrounding both September and October rent payments, as follows:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text message that she would waive the late fee for September's rent. Despite this, on <strong>September 25, 2024</strong>, I received a <strong>"Pay or Quit"</strong> notice from Matt Stickler, giving me only five days to pay the full amount of $4,600 (comprising $4,000 for September rent and $600 in late fees). I attempted to pay the rent by the landlord’s requested deadline of <strong>September 30, 2024</strong>, despite the short notice and the fact that it did not align with the lease terms. I reached out via text to ask if someone was in the office to receive the payment and even offered to give it to Matt's assistant, but was informed that Logan was not authorized to accept the rent on behalf of DBG Properties. No alternative means of payment was provided at that time.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay October rent as per usual, before the 5th of the month. However, between 3:30 PM and 5:00 PM, no one was present in the office to accept payment. On the following Monday, October 7, 2024, my manager went to your office with <strong>$8,000</strong> in cash to pay both September and October rent, but the office secretary made a phone call and was instructed <strong>not to accept the payment</strong>. No reason for the refusal was provided, preventing us from curing the alleged default.</ul></li>

While I do not wish to make any direct accusations, these events could be interpreted as an effort to force a default, as I was actively prevented from fulfilling my lease obligations despite making good-faith attempts to pay rent on time.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro & The Cellar Door</strong></h3>
Your notice also implies that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is operating as a bar, in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, which prohibits such use. However, this is a mischaracterization of our operations. Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is a singular, multi-level establishment operated under <strong>Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, with each level having its own name and ambiance but operating under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease agreement.

In accordance with <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, the lease permits the premises to be used as a restaurant, and the service of alcohol by the glass is expressly allowed. Per West Virginia Code §60-7-2, a restaurant is defined as an establishment where <strong>food sales are the primary source of revenue</strong>, and alcohol sales are secondary. We consistently meet the legal requirement of deriving at least <strong>60% of our revenue from food sales</strong>, confirming that we are operating as a restaurant and not as a bar.

Additionally, while we adhere to posted closing times by turning off our "open" sign and ceasing to seat new guests, we do allow existing guests to finish enjoying their experience with us. This is standard practice in the industry and does not constitute a violation of the lease.

<h3>4. <strong>Insurance Lapse and Rectification</strong></h3>
Regarding the insurance lapse, we became aware of it after the bank account tied to our insurance payments was closed due to fraud. The lapse involved only one of our three required policies, while the other two policies were transferred immediately to the new account. As soon as we found out about the lapse, we began working to obtain a new policy. The replacement policy should be finalized and active by this evening, or at the latest, tomorrow.

<strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong> of the lease provides a <strong>30-day period</strong> for me to cure non-rent-related breaches, including insurance lapses. I was never provided with formal written notice or an opportunity to cure this issue before it was cited as grounds for termination. Therefore, this cannot serve as a basis for immediate lease termination.

<h3>5. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong></h3>
In light of the points discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, be retracted on the following grounds:
<ul>   - The alleged "repeated defaults" were not properly documented with <strong>written notice</strong>, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> of the lease.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">My good-faith attempts to pay rent were actively <strong>refused</strong>, preventing me from curing the alleged default.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">There has been no operational breach under <strong>Section 7(a)</strong>, and we are fully compliant with West Virginia law governing restaurants.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is in the process of being rectified, and no formal <strong>30-day notice</strong> was provided, as required under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</ul></li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
I remain committed to fulfilling all obligations under the lease and am hopeful we can resolve these issues cooperatively. Given the procedural and factual inaccuracies, I respectfully request that you retract the Notice of Lease Termination and confirm that Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc. will be allowed to continue its occupancy under the lease’s terms.

Please confirm receipt of this letter and the retraction of the termination notice. Should you require any further documentation or clarification, I am available to provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I’m open to potentially ending the lease early but there is no way i can begin moving them until January at the earliest. Preferably march. But I’ll fight tooth and nail to stay in the space until the end of December, even if i have to file the injunction or even chapter 11 bankruptcy to prevent an eviction process.

<strong>Subject: Response to Notice of Lease Termination and Inaccurate Claims</strong>

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to your Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024. There are several critical issues that need to be addressed, including inaccuracies regarding rent payment defaults, operational compliance, and the recent insurance lapse. I would also like to point out what appears to be a broader motivation behind these actions, given the longstanding relationship we have had with DBG Properties since September 2020.

<h3>1. <strong>Rebuttal to Claims of "Repeated Default"</strong></h3>
The notice of termination cites "repeated default" based on alleged late rent payments. While I acknowledge that rent has been paid late on <strong>multiple occasions</strong> in the past 12 months, it is important to clarify how this relates to the lease terms. 

<strong>Section 24(f)</strong> of the lease allows the landlord to cite prior late rent payments toward a claim of "repeated default" and potentially use them to terminate the lease. However, this right is contingent upon strict procedural requirements, as outlined in <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> of the lease. Specifically, these sections require that any such late payments be documented through <strong>written notice</strong>, giving the tenant an opportunity to cure the default within 10 business days.

In this case, no such formal written notices were provided for any of the past late payments. As a result, while prior late payments could theoretically be used to justify lease termination, the failure to follow the required notice procedures renders the claim of repeated default procedurally improper.

Moreover, we have been renting this space from DBG Properties since September 2020. During this time, you have been well aware of the <strong>seasonal fluctuations in our cash flow</strong>, which have occasionally resulted in late rent payments at various points throughout the year. We have always worked through these fluctuations, and you have continued to accept rent without raising significant issues until now. This sudden change in tone suggests there may be a motive beyond just rent collection.

<h3>2. <strong>Attempt to Cure September and October Rent Payments</strong></h3>
I would like to clarify the circumstances surrounding both September and October rent payments, as follows:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September Rent</strong>: On September 20, 2024, Debbie informed me via text message that she would waive the late fee for September's rent. Despite this, on <strong>September 25, 2024</strong>, I received a <strong>"Pay or Quit"</strong> notice from Matt Stickler, giving me only five days to pay the full amount of $4,600 (comprising $4,000 for September rent and $600 in late fees). I attempted to pay the rent by the landlord’s requested deadline of <strong>September 30, 2024</strong>, despite the short notice and the fact that it did not align with the lease terms. I reached out via text to ask if someone was in the office to receive the payment and even offered to give it to Matt's assistant, but was informed that Logan was not authorized to accept the rent on behalf of DBG Properties. No alternative means of payment was provided at that time.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October Rent</strong>: I attempted to pay October rent as per usual, before the 5th of the month. However, between 3:30 PM and 5:00 PM, no one was present in the office to accept payment. On the following Monday, October 7, 2024, my manager went to your office with <strong>$8,000</strong> in cash to pay both September and October rent, but the office secretary made a phone call and was instructed <strong>not to accept the payment</strong>. No reason for the refusal was provided, preventing us from curing the alleged default.</ul></li>

These actions, combined with the sudden change in approach despite years of working through late payments together, lead me to believe that this termination notice may not be entirely about the rent. While I do not wish to directly accuse anyone, this behavior could be interpreted as an effort to force a default, given that I was actively prevented from fulfilling my lease obligations despite making good-faith efforts to do so.

<h3>3. <strong>Inaccurate Allegations Regarding the Operation of Le Bistro & The Cellar Door</strong></h3>
Your notice also implies that Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is operating as a bar, in violation of <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, which prohibits such use. However, this is a mischaracterization of our operations. Le Bistro & The Cellar Door is a singular, multi-level establishment operated under <strong>Abraham Restaurant Industries Inc.</strong>, with each level having its own name and ambiance but operating under the same business license, alcohol license, and lease agreement.

I was never provided with formal written notice or an opportunity to cure this issue before it was cited as grounds for termination. Therefore, this cannot serve as a basis for immediate lease termination.

<h3>5. <strong>Potential Resolution</strong></h3>
While I am willing to discuss <strong>potentially ending the lease early</strong>, I cannot begin moving out before January at the earliest, and ideally, I would need until March to complete the transition. However, I am prepared to fight vigorously to remain in the space until the end of December, if necessary. If needed, I will explore every available legal avenue, including filing an <strong>injunction</strong> to prevent eviction, or even pursuing <strong>Chapter 11 bankruptcy</strong> to maintain occupancy and protect the business.

I also believe that DBG Properties' actions, including the refusal to accept rent and failure to provide proper notice, are in violation of multiple elements of the lease, suggesting a lack of good faith. Given these facts, I am confident that a court would rule in my favor if this situation were to escalate to litigation.

<h3>6. <strong>Improper Termination Procedures</strong></h3>
In light of the points discussed above, I respectfully request that the Notice of Lease Termination dated October 8, 2024, be retracted on the following grounds:
<ul>   - The alleged "repeated defaults" were not properly documented with <strong>written notice</strong>, as required by <strong>Section 24(a)(i)</strong> and <strong>Section 36</strong> of the lease.

<li class="list-disc ml-6">The insurance lapse is in the process of being rectified, and no formal <strong>30-day notice</strong> was provided, as required under <strong>Section 24(a)(ii)</strong>.</ul></li>
