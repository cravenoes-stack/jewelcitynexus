                <div class="message-content">Here's a step-by-step guide to using your ad copy, creatives, and campaign strategy for social media posts and paid ads:

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Assets**
You’ll need:
- **Ad copy** (already written)
- **Creative image** (the one generated above)
- **Target audience details** (you’ve identified Halloween enthusiasts, likely adults aged 18-40 with an interest in immersive experiences and mysteries)
- **Call-to-action (CTA)** (encouraging booking or RSVPs with phrases like “Book Now” or “Secure Your Spot”)

### **Step 2: Create Organic Social Media Posts**

#### **For Facebook &amp; Instagram:**
1. **Image Post:**
   - Upload the creative image to your post.
   - Use the following caption:

   **Caption:**  
   "🔮 Ready for a night of mystery, magic, and mayhem? Join The Hexed Circle this Halloween and unravel the secrets of a coven murder!  
   Costumes encouraged. Spots are limited, so don't wait—book your place now! 🕯️✨"

   **Hashtags:**  
   #HalloweenEvent #MurderMystery #TheHexedCircle #WitchyVibes #Halloween2024 #MysteryNight #MagicAndMayhem

2. **Story Posts:**
   - Use the creative image in Instagram Stories.
   - Add a **swipe-up link** (if available) or prompt users to “Check the Link in Bio” for bookings.
   - Include engaging text like:  
   “Can you solve the mystery? 🧙‍♀️🔮 Join the coven this Halloween. Spots are limited!”

#### **For Twitter/X:**
1. **Tweet:**
   - Post a shorter version of the copy with the image:

   **Tweet:**  
   "Unravel the mystery this Halloween with The Hexed Circle! 🧙‍♀️ A night of magic, secrets, and a coven murder. Limited spots—secure yours now! 🎃🔮 #MurderMystery #HalloweenEvent #TheHexedCircle"

2. **Promoted Tweet (optional):**
   - Boost the post with a targeted audience (focus on Halloween enthusiasts, escape room fans, and immersive event-goers).

### **Step 3: Set Up Paid Ads**

#### **For Facebook &amp; Instagram Ads:**
1. **Ad Objective:** Choose "Event Responses" or "Website Visits" (to drive traffic to your booking page).
2. **Target Audience:**
   - Location: Target local area (city or region where the event takes place).
   - Age: 18-40.
   - Interests: Halloween, immersive experiences, murder mystery, escape rooms, cosplay, fantasy books and films.
3. **Creative Setup:**
   - Upload the creative image.
   - Use the following ad copy:

   **Primary Text:**  
   "This Halloween, join the coven and uncover the mysteries of The Hexed Circle. Costumes, magic, and a murder await—can you solve it before time runs out? 🧙‍♀️✨ Limited spots available—book your spot today!"

   **Headline:**  
   "Join The Hexed Circle: Halloween Murder Mystery"

   **Call to Action (CTA):**  
   "Book Now"

4. **Ad Budget:**  
   Set your budget based on the number of bookings you want to achieve, and run the ads at least 2-3 weeks before the event to build awareness.

#### **For Google Ads:**
1. **Create a New Campaign:**
   - Choose the campaign type: "Search" or "Display" (for visual ads).
2. **Target Keywords:**  
   Use keywords like:  
   - "Halloween murder mystery"  
   - "immersive Halloween event"  
   - "coven mystery game"  
   - "Halloween activities near me"

3. **Ad Copy:**
   - Use the following headlines and descriptions in your Google Ads campaign:

   **Headlines:**  
   - "Solve The Hexed Circle Mystery"  
   - "Join a Coven Halloween Experience"  
   - "Uncover Secrets &amp; Intrigue"

   **Descriptions:**  
   - "Step into a world of magic and mystery. Become part of the coven and solve the murder before time runs out!"  
   - "A Halloween event filled with suspense, clues, and magic. Reserve your spot now for The Hexed Circle!"

4. **Landing Page:**  
   Ensure your landing page (event booking page) is optimized with the same visuals and messaging as your ads, along with a prominent **Book Now** button.

### **Step 4: Track and Optimize**
1. **Monitor Engagement:**
   - Use social media insights (on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X) to track engagement, clicks, and RSVPs.
   - Adjust your budget based on which platforms are performing best.
   
2. **Retargeting:**

                <div class="message-content">It looks like you've uploaded screenshots related to setting up your Facebook ad campaign. Based on your goal and setup:

### 1. **Special Ad Categories**
   Since your event does not fall under credit, employment, housing, or social issues, you **do not need to declare a special ad category**. Skip this section unless your campaign involves one of the specified areas.

### 2. **Campaign Objective**
   For your campaign, since you're focused on driving **ticket sales** for your event, **choose "Sales"** as your campaign objective. This will allow Facebook to optimize for conversions, driving traffic directly to your purchase page and helping convert that traffic into bookings.

### 3. **Advantage+ Catalog Ads and Campaign Budget**
   - **Advantage+ Catalog Ads:** You can keep this **off** unless you have a product catalog set up with Facebook, which is not necessary for an event-based ad campaign.
   - **Advantage Campaign Budget:** It is recommended to turn this **on** if you have multiple ad sets within this campaign. Facebook will automatically allocate the budget to the best-performing ad set. However, if you're running a simple, single ad set campaign, you can leave it **off** and manually control the budget.

### 4. **A/B Testing**
   If you want to test different versions of your ad (e.g., varying headlines, creatives, or targeting options), consider turning **A/B Testing on**. This can help you optimize performance by showing you which version resonates best with your audience. However, if you're happy with the setup and want to run a straightforward campaign, you can leave it **off** for now.

Regarding your website, I cannot view live websites directly. However, if you'd like me to check specific information or elements, feel free to describe it, and I can help you optimize or troubleshoot based on that!
