<h3><strong>Lease Dispute Summary</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Context and Lease Terms</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Your businesses, <em>Le Bistro</em> and <em>The Cellar Door</em>, operate on different floors of the same establishment under the same lease and business license.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The lease specifies that notices must be sent by certified mail, and to date, the only certified notice you’ve received was on October 8th.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Operational Details</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Your establishments sell significantly more food than alcohol, which is relevant to proving that your business is not operating solely as a bar.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The Cellar Door’s operating hours were maintained as per lease requirements, with the open sign turned off and no new guests accepted at closing time, though guests present before closing may stay afterward. Hours are consistently posted on the website and social media.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Key Property and Security Concerns</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - DBG Properties has not addressed your repeated requests to change the back door code, an important security issue considering the high turnover rate of employees.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The double doors, which provide handicap access, only open during weekday lunch hours. This intermittent access prevents wheelchair access during at least 50% of your open hours, a point you wish to frame as an ADA violation.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You documented that a DBG employee, implied to be Matt Stickler’s son, entered your restaurant in the early morning hours without notice and appeared intoxicated. You’ve subtly hinted at this knowledge in your correspondence to let management know you're aware without explicitly naming the individual.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Fixture Disputes</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - You clarified that the chandeliers and pendant lights were installed for decorative purposes, with adequate lighting from recessed lights already in place, and argued they qualify as trade fixtures per Section 11(e) of the lease. You intend to remove these fixtures and have assured the landlord that removal will avoid damage, with any minor repairs addressed.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Attempts to Pay Rent</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Attempts to pay rent were documented on September 30 and October 4. Additionally, the landlord was either unavailable to accept payments or refused them on these dates, which you may mention in your response.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Handling of Lease Termination Notice</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - In your last correspondence, you included exact food-to-alcohol sales percentages, lease sections for direct reference, and reiterated your compliance with lease terms. You also addressed the importance of the chandeliers as trade fixtures for your niche market.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Since you’ve received no response from building management regarding this last letter, today is your final day to take further action.</ul></li>

<h3><strong>Options Moving Forward</strong></h3>

Since management has not responded by today, and given that they proceeded with a termination notice, the restraining order and injunction approach remains the next logical course. Here’s what to consider:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Filing a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Purpose</strong>: The TRO would prevent the landlord from further action to terminate the lease until a court hearing, giving you time to prepare for the injunction.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Expected Timeline</strong>: TROs are generally resolved quickly, often within a day or so, depending on the court’s availability. You’ll want to file this as early as possible today to maximize your chance of a same-day ruling.</ul></li>
<ol>   
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Filing for an Injunction</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Purpose</strong>: An injunction would provide more long-term protection, barring the landlord from termination or eviction actions until a full legal hearing can determine the lease dispute’s outcome.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Process</strong>: After obtaining a TRO, you would typically schedule a hearing for the injunction, presenting evidence that you’ve complied with the lease and made every reasonable attempt to meet your obligations.</ul></li>
<ol>   
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Potential Outcomes and Legal Support</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - If granted, the TRO and subsequent injunction can allow you to continue operations without immediate threat of eviction, pending a final judgment on the dispute.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Retaining or consulting with a commercial lease attorney is advisable to ensure all legal arguments are thoroughly presented, especially given the time-sensitive nature of today’s action.</ul></li>

If you proceed quickly with filing, securing the TRO within the day is feasible, as these orders are typically granted on an emergency basis when immediate action is required. Let me know if you need additional guidance on specific steps for filing or on any other details for your documentation.</div>
                        </div>
                    
                        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4 shadow-sm">
                            <div class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">User</div>
                            <div class="message-text">I will need additional guidance on next steps and how to file the TRO; however, before I do that, I would like to know if I have any grounds for suing our landlord for the damage done to the business throughout this process? Our sales have suffered due to me not being able to focus on operations, I have 8 years of October sales that can show this, our reputation has been damaged, there are rumors around the city that the building manager has created this scenario because his son and his son’s friends are trying to open a bar in my location, and more. </div>
                        </div>
                    
                        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4 shadow-sm">
                            <div class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Assistant</div>
                            <div class="message-text">It sounds like you may have potential grounds for a lawsuit against your landlord for damages, particularly if you can establish that their actions have caused significant financial and reputational harm to your business. Here’s a breakdown of key points that could support a potential case, followed by guidance on how to document these points and the next steps for filing the TRO.

<h3><strong>Potential Grounds for Suing the Landlord</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Intentional Interference with Business Operations</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - If the building manager or landlord deliberately engaged in actions to disrupt your business (such as refusing rent payments, obstructing your ability to operate, or creating barriers to accessible entry), this could constitute interference with your right to quiet enjoyment of the premises, which is typically protected by commercial leases.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Additionally, if the landlord has spread misinformation or allowed the propagation of rumors to harm your reputation, you may have a claim for intentional interference with your business relationships.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Breach of Contract</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - If the landlord failed to meet their lease obligations (such as ensuring a secure, accessible premise), you could argue breach of contract. The issues with handicap access and the back door security code, which you’ve requested multiple times to be updated, can be included as evidence of the landlord’s failure to meet their responsibilities.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The lack of response to your written concerns about these matters may strengthen your case.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Loss of Business Due to Landlord’s Actions</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - The impact on sales and reputation can be highlighted here. If you have eight years of data showing consistent October sales prior to this disruption, you can potentially quantify financial losses resulting directly from this conflict.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Testimony or statements from patrons, employees, or community members about observed effects on your business or any rumors they’ve heard can also support this.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Although a less common claim in commercial cases, you might argue that the landlord’s repeated refusals to address issues (such as accepting rent and addressing ADA concerns) have placed undue stress on your business operations, especially if this situation has affected your ability to manage the day-to-day work required to operate a restaurant.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Defamation and Damage to Reputation</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - If you can substantiate rumors that the building manager or landlord encouraged or created misinformation about your business to benefit a potential competing bar, you might have a claim for defamation, particularly if this caused a measurable impact on your sales.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Witnesses who can attest to these rumors (e.g., regular customers, employees, or city community members) may strengthen your case.</ul></li>

<h3><strong>Steps to Document and Prepare for a Lawsuit</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Collect Historical Sales Data</strong>: Gather October sales data from the last eight years and calculate the variance this year to demonstrate the financial impact of the landlord's actions.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Compile Evidence of Lease Compliance</strong>: Organize documentation showing that you followed the lease terms, including rent payment attempts, communications with the landlord, and any records of the landlord’s refusal to accept payments.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Document Property and Security Concerns</strong>: Include records of your requests for code changes, handicap access, and any incidents involving unauthorized entry. You might also want to document the specific times these requests were made and how they were handled.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Gather Witness Statements</strong>: Ask patrons, employees, or community members who are aware of the rumors or have noticed operational disruptions to provide statements.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Create a Timeline of Events</strong>: Document key events, such as when the landlord first refused payment, when you requested repairs or security changes, and when you noticed sales declines due to the lease dispute.</ol></li>

<h3><strong>Filing the TRO and Pursuing an Injunction</strong></h3>

Given today’s time constraint, the TRO needs immediate attention. Here’s a step-by-step guide for filing:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Prepare Documentation</strong>: </ol></li>
<ul>   - Bring all relevant documentation, including proof of lease compliance, correspondence, and payment attempts, to court.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">If possible, prepare a summarized timeline of events and a list of damages already incurred (like sales loss) to demonstrate urgency.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Draft the TRO Petition</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - In your petition, explain the emergency nature of the request and why a TRO is necessary to prevent further harm.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Include details about the landlord’s interference, such as refusing rent payments and creating barriers to operational success, which has caused financial strain and threatened your business’s survival.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>File the TRO at the Courthouse</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - TROs are typically filed in the civil division of your local courthouse. Some jurisdictions may offer an expedited process for business disputes, so ask the court clerk about this possibility to try and get it in front of a judge today.</ul>
<ol>   
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Attend the Hearing</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Be prepared to argue that the TRO is essential for protecting your right to continue operating, highlighting the disruption to sales and accessibility issues. If the TRO is granted, it will temporarily halt any eviction or lease termination efforts by the landlord.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Plan for the Injunction Hearing</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Once the TRO is in place, you can request a hearing for a preliminary injunction, which would extend the order until a final ruling. This hearing will allow you to present all gathered evidence more thoroughly, emphasizing the landlord’s harmful behavior and any breach of lease terms.</ul>

If the TRO is granted, it buys you critical time to pursue a more permanent solution and potentially explore a lawsuit for damages. I recommend consulting an attorney who specializes in commercial lease disputes to strengthen your case for damages and guide you through this legal process.</div>

This review includes all the key details for the TRO and potential injunction, emphasizing evidence of lease compliance, interference from building management, operational disruption, and grounds for damages.

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>TRO and Injunction Application Overview</strong></h3>

<h4>1. <strong>Lease Compliance and Rent Payment Attempts</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Compliance with Lease Terms</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Your business operates within the lease terms, with both <em>Le Bistro</em> and <em>The Cellar Door</em> under one lease and business license.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Operational hours are maintained as stipulated, with open signs turned off at closing time and no new guests allowed after hours, yet guests already seated are allowed to remain.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No indication or documentation from the landlord suggests otherwise, which can reinforce your position that your actions have adhered to lease requirements.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Documented Rent Payment Attempts</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Rent payment attempts on <strong>September 30</strong> and <strong>October 4</strong> were unsuccessful as the landlord either refused payment or was unavailable to accept it.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">No certified mail notice of payment delinquency or lease termination was provided, aside from the single certified letter dated <strong>October 8</strong>.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">These documented attempts provide evidence that you acted in good faith to maintain compliance with the financial obligations under the lease.</ul></li>

<h4>2. <strong>Security and Accessibility Concerns</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Security Code and Back Door Issues</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Repeated requests for updating the back door code due to high turnover (65+ employees in 12 months knowing the code) were ignored by DBG Properties. This unaddressed security lapse creates liability and undermines the safety of your operations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>ADA Violation – Handicap Access</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The double doors leading to The Cellar Door (the only handicap-accessible entrance) operate intermittently and only during weekday lunch hours, preventing wheelchair access during more than 50% of your open hours. This issue is relevant to ADA compliance and presents grounds to claim that the landlord’s negligence has restricted access for disabled patrons.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Unauthorized Entry by DBG Employee</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Evidence suggests a DBG employee has entered the property between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM without notice, reportedly under the influence. This entry may involve Matt Stickler’s son, Logan, a former employee of yours, which you subtly noted in correspondence. The landlord’s lack of oversight or accountability here further undermines the safety and security of your business premises.</ul></li>

<h4>3. <strong>Fixture Disputes and Trade Fixtures</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Ownership and Removal of Decorative Fixtures</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The chandeliers, pendant lights, and custom bar/shelving were installed for specific aesthetic and operational purposes, and their removal will not affect the basic functionality of the space due to adequate recessed and dome lighting. These items qualify as trade fixtures under <strong>Section 11(e)</strong> of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You have committed to removing fixtures without damage, with any necessary minor repairs handled responsibly.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Documentation and Legal Precedents for Trade Fixtures</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Reference to Section 11(e) and industry standards for trade fixtures supports your claim to these fixtures and weakens the landlord’s potential argument against their removal.</ul></li>

<h4>4. <strong>Impact on Business Operations</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Sales Decline Due to Landlord’s Actions</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">October sales this year reflect a notable decline compared to the past eight years, directly correlating with the operational disruption caused by this lease dispute. Historical October data could quantify financial damages and highlight the loss associated with being unable to focus on core business functions.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Reputational Damage and Market Rumors</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Rumors indicate that the building manager (or associates) may be creating obstacles to pave the way for his son and friends to open a competing bar at your location. These rumors, alongside the dispute, have impacted your business reputation and could be argued as intentional interference with business relations.</ul></li>

<h4>5. <strong>Documentation for TRO and Potential Lawsuit</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Timeline of Events</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">A documented sequence of your compliance with lease obligations, ignored repair and security requests, and attempted rent payments supports your argument for immediate protection under the TRO.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Key Dates</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September 30</strong> & <strong>October 4</strong>: Rent payment attempts.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 8</strong>: Receipt of certified mail notice.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Today</strong>: Last day to take action, prompting the filing for a TRO.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Impact Statements</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Collect testimonials from regular customers, staff, or community members attesting to observed operational changes, sales declines, or the reputation impact due to the dispute.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Visual Evidence and Correspondence</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Photos of fixtures you plan to remove, building accessibility issues, and any written communications or requests to DBG Properties regarding repairs, rent payment attempts, or security concerns.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Steps for Filing the TRO</strong></h3>

With the above information ready, here’s how to proceed:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Prepare and File TRO Petition</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - In your petition, include the grounds outlined above, emphasizing lease compliance, failed payment attempts due to landlord refusal, security risks, accessibility issues, and financial/reputational damages.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Highlight the urgent need to prevent further action from the landlord that could threaten your business continuity, stressing that the TRO will provide time to settle these disputes in court.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Attend TRO Hearing</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Be prepared to clearly articulate each point, and present your evidence with a focus on lease compliance, your good-faith efforts, the landlord’s lack of response, and the harm caused by their actions.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Request that the TRO be granted to halt any lease termination or eviction actions, with a scheduled follow-up hearing for the injunction.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Building a Case for Damages</strong></h3>

Once the TRO is filed, this groundwork will serve to support a more comprehensive case for damages against the landlord. Here are the next steps in building that case:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Contact an Attorney</strong>: </ol></li>
<ul>   - Look for an attorney specializing in commercial leases or business disputes, who can help refine these claims and represent your interests effectively in seeking damages.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Quantify Financial Damages</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Use historical sales data to establish a clear financial impact for October, demonstrating the decline this year and associating it with the landlord’s actions and the dispute’s distraction from operations.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Gather Witness Statements and Reputation Evidence</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Reach out to customers, employees, and community members for statements on observed business impact or to confirm rumors. Social media, review sites, or testimonials about operational disruption could strengthen this argument.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Compile ADA Violations and Security Concerns</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Present evidence of the ignored requests for ADA accessibility and security improvements, showing a disregard for the safe, inclusive operation of your business.</ul>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">

Here’s an updated structure with this added detail, ensuring every documented attempt and issue is clearly presented in your TRO and potential lawsuit preparations.

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Updated TRO and Injunction Application Overview</strong></h3>

<h4>1. <strong>Lease Compliance and Multiple Rent Payment Attempts</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Demonstrated Compliance with Lease Terms</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><em>Le Bistro</em> and <em>The Cellar Door</em> operate under the same lease and business license, and you've adhered to operational hours as required by the lease. Closing procedures align with lease stipulations, as you cease taking new guests at the designated closing times while allowing seated guests to remain until they choose to leave.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You have upheld all other lease responsibilities and posted consistent hours on both your website and social media platforms.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Good-Faith Attempts to Pay Rent</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You attempted to pay both September and October rent on three separate occasions:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September 30</strong></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 4</strong></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 7</strong></li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The landlord or property management refused to accept payment each time, including on <strong>October 7</strong> in the morning.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The only certified notice you received was on <strong>October 8</strong>, after these payment attempts, indicating a lack of responsive and proper communication on their part.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">This sequence of attempts evidences your consistent efforts to fulfill financial obligations, countering any claim of delinquency on your end.</ul></li>

<h4>2. <strong>Security Risks and Accessibility Issues</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Unaddressed Security Concerns with Back Door Code</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties ignored repeated requests to update the back door code despite high employee turnover (65+ employees in the past year knowing the code). This refusal compromised security, posing a risk to your operations and business property.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>ADA Violation – Restricted Handicap Access</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The double doors, which are the only handicap-accessible entry to The Cellar Door, operate irregularly, allowing access only during weekday lunch hours, thus blocking wheelchair access for at least 50% of your open hours. This creates an accessibility barrier that could constitute an ADA violation, adding weight to your claims of landlord neglect.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Unauthorized Entry by DBG Employee</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Reports indicate a DBG employee, believed to be Logan Stickler, entered the premises between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM without notice and appeared intoxicated. This incident, which you referenced indirectly in correspondence, reflects a lack of landlord accountability over employee actions, further compromising the security of your business.</ul></li>

<h4>3. <strong>Fixture Ownership and Removal Rights</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Trade Fixture Justification for Decorative Installations</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You clarified that the chandeliers, pendant lights, and custom bar fixtures installed for your unique upscale concept qualify as trade fixtures under <strong>Section 11(e)</strong> of the lease, supporting your right to remove them without affecting basic space functionality. The space is adequately lit with recessed lighting and dome lights, so fixture removal would not impact operational safety or usability.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Commitment to Responsible Fixture Removal</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">You have ensured the landlord that removal of these fixtures will be performed without damaging the space, and you are prepared to address any minor repairs as needed, demonstrating further good faith in managing the leased premises.</ul></li>

<h4>4. <strong>Operational and Reputational Damage</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Quantifiable Sales Decline Due to Lease Dispute</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Your October sales have suffered significantly this year, a deviation from the stable October sales pattern over the past eight years. This financial impact, which can be backed by historical data, directly correlates with the distraction and operational strain caused by the lease dispute.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Reputational Harm from Potential Market Rumors</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Reports suggest that the building manager or their associates may be undermining your business to create an opportunity for a competing bar in your location. Such rumors have affected your business reputation in the community and could serve as evidence of intentional interference with your business relationships.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Next Steps for Filing the TRO</strong></h3>

With the inclusion of your additional rent payment attempt on <strong>October 7</strong>, your documentation for the TRO is even stronger. Here’s an action plan:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Complete the TRO Petition</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Clearly outline your compliance with lease terms, your multiple payment attempts (September 30, October 4, October 7), and the landlord’s refusal to accept rent. Stress that the TRO is necessary to halt any immediate termination or eviction actions until a court hearing.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Highlight the harm from unaddressed security and accessibility issues, as well as financial and reputational damages, including sales declines.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Submit and Attend the TRO Hearing</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - File the TRO at your local courthouse’s civil division and request an emergency hearing due to today’s deadline.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Present your evidence, emphasizing the landlord’s refusal to accept payment, unaddressed security and accessibility concerns, and the immediate need to protect your business from further harm.</ul></li>

“DBG Properties LLC
911 3rd Avenue, Suite 210
Huntington, WV 25701

October 2nd, 2024

Attn: Matt Stickler

Dear Matt,

I am writing in response to the Notice of Event of Default issued on October 1, 2024, and the preceding Notice to Pay or Quit delivered on September 25, 2024.

While rent has been late on prior occasions, this is the first written notice I have received regarding any rent default. Under Section 24 of the lease, the landlord is required to provide written notice for any late rent payments and allow me 10 business days to cure the default. Since you did not provide any prior written notices for previous late payments and accepted the rent without objection, the landlord has waived the right to enforce the “repeated default” clause in Section 24(f) of the lease. Therefore, any attempt to terminate the lease based on prior late payments is invalid.

Additionally, neither the Notice to Pay or Quit nor the Notice of Event of Default were delivered in accordance with the lease’s terms. Section 36 (Notices) requires that official notices be delivered via certified mail, registered mail, or by a recognized courier. The Notice to Pay or Quit was personally delivered by the building manager, and the Notice of Event of Default was delivered by his office assistant. Neither notice was delivered in accordance with the lease’s delivery requirements, making them procedurally improper.

Finally, the Notice of Event of Default issued on October 1, 2024, was premature. The lease grants me 10 business days to cure any rent default, meaning I have until October 9, 2024, to resolve the matter. Issuing the Notice of Default only 4 business days after the Notice to Pay or Quit fails to allow me the full time to cure the default, as required by the lease.

I am prepared to cure any outstanding rent default within the 10-business-day period and request that you retract both the Notice of Default and the Notice to Pay or Quit, as they were improperly issued and do not comply with the terms of the lease.

Please confirm that you will adhere to the lease’s terms and delivery requirements moving forward.

Sincerely,
Christopher Craven
President, NAVI Inc.

Huntington, WV 25701”

                            <div class="message-text">Based on the extensive documentation and correspondence you've provided, here’s a comprehensive summary of your lease dispute with DBG Properties, followed by a recap of the actions you've taken and the issues at hand.

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Comprehensive Summary of the Lease Dispute</strong></h3>

<h4>1. <strong>Rent Payment History and Attempted Payments</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Background on Rent Payments</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Late rent payments have occurred occasionally, but DBG Properties had accepted them without objection over 40 out of 45 months. This created a reasonable expectation that late payments were tolerated, especially given your seasonal cash flow variations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Attempts to Cure September and October Rent</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">On <strong>September 20</strong>, Debbie from DBG Properties texted that the late fee would be waived.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">On <strong>September 25</strong>, you received a "Notice to Pay or Quit" for $4,600 (including a $600 late fee) due by <strong>September 30</strong>.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Payment attempts were made on:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September 30</strong> – You attempted to pay before the deadline.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 4</strong> – Attempted to pay, but DBG Properties was unavailable after 3:30 PM.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 7</strong> – Your manager delivered $8,000 in cash to cover both September and October rent, but DBG Properties refused to accept it.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 8</strong> – A "Notice of Event of Default" was delivered, asserting lease termination for repeated default without considering the payment attempts made and without honoring the lease’s cure period.</ul></li>

<h4>2. <strong>Procedural Violations by DBG Properties</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Failure to Follow Notice Requirements</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The lease requires all official notices to be sent via certified or registered mail, yet:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The "Notice to Pay or Quit" was hand-delivered by the building manager.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The "Notice of Event of Default" was delivered by an office assistant.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">These procedural deviations invalidate the notices as they did not comply with Section 36 (Notices) of the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Premature Default Notice</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The lease allows a 10-business-day cure period for rent defaults. Since the "Notice to Pay or Quit" was delivered on <strong>September 25</strong>, the earliest valid "Notice of Default" could be issued was <strong>October 9</strong>. The issuance of the default notice on <strong>October 1</strong> was premature, disregarding the lease’s stipulated cure period.</ul></li>

<h4>3. <strong>Claims of Non-Compliance and Lease Violations</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Allegations of Operating as a Bar</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties claimed that your businesses operate as a bar in violation of Section 7(b). However, your data shows <strong>70.11% of revenue from food sales</strong>, classifying your business as a restaurant under both state law (WV Code §60-7-2) and the lease.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Insurance Lapse</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Due to a fraudulent incident requiring a change in bank accounts, one of your insurance policies temporarily lapsed. You took immediate action to rectify this, and the policy was being reinstated. According to Section 24(a)(ii), a 30-day cure period should be provided for non-rent defaults like insurance issues, but DBG Properties cited this as a cause for termination without giving you the chance to cure it.</ul></li>

<h4>4. <strong>Accessibility and Security Concerns</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>ADA Compliance Issue</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The double doors providing the only wheelchair access to The Cellar Door are not consistently operational, restricting access for at least 50% of open hours. Despite multiple requests, DBG Properties has not fixed this issue, raising potential ADA violations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Back Door Security Concerns</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Due to high employee turnover (65+ employees in a year), you've repeatedly asked DBG Properties to change the back door code for security reasons. These requests were ignored, compromising your business’s security.</ul></li>

<h4>5. <strong>Right to Quiet Enjoyment and Reputation Damage</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Unauthorized Access</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">There have been signs of unauthorized entry into your premises, potentially by DBG Properties employees. DBG Properties was indirectly made aware, hinting that you are aware of these actions.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Circulation of Eviction Rumors</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">False rumors about your potential eviction have been circulating in the community, potentially damaging your reputation and ability to hire staff. These details appear to have originated from DBG Properties, further impacting your business negatively.</ul></li>

<h4>6. <strong>Trade Fixtures and Property Ownership</strong></h4>
<ul>   - <strong>Rights to Fixtures</strong>:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">According to Section 11(e) of the lease, you retain ownership of trade fixtures and intend to remove chandeliers, custom bars, shelving, and kitchen equipment upon vacating the premises. These fixtures will be removed without causing significant damage, and any minor repairs will be addressed as needed.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Key Actions Taken</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>October 2 Response to Notice of Default</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - You sent a certified response to DBG Properties outlining procedural issues, payment attempts, and clarifying that the default notice was issued prematurely. You requested retraction of the notices, asserting compliance with lease terms and procedural impropriety in DBG Properties’ actions.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>October 28 Final Response</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - This response addressed each of DBG Properties’ claims, providing:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Proof of majority food sales, proving compliance with the lease's permitted use clause.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Documentation of attempts to pay rent on multiple dates, highlighting DBG Properties’ refusal to accept payment.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Explanation of the brief insurance lapse and assurance of corrective measures.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">ADA accessibility issues due to inconsistent double door operation.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Rights to remove trade fixtures per lease terms.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Objections to the misinformation spread by DBG Properties that impacted your business reputation and right to quiet enjoyment.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Summary of Grounds for Filing the TRO</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Compliance with Lease Terms</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Demonstrated good-faith efforts to pay rent and cure defaults. DBG Properties’ repeated refusal to accept payments and failure to provide the required cure period have jeopardized your business continuity.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Procedural Violations</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Notices were improperly delivered in violation of the lease requirements, undermining DBG Properties’ claims of default.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Claims of Harmful Conduct</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - DBG Properties’ actions, including spreading misinformation and allowing unauthorized access, have impaired your business operations, reputation, and security.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>ADA Violation</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - Failure to ensure ADA-compliant access further supports your case, indicating negligence by DBG Properties in maintaining the premises.</ul>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Next Steps for Filing the TRO</strong></h3>

Using this summary, you are in a strong position to file the TRO. Key points to emphasize include:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Good-Faith Efforts to Pay Rent</strong>: Multiple attempts to cure defaults with DBG Properties refusing payments on September 30, October 4, and October 7.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Procedural Impropriety</strong>: Notices were not delivered according to the lease’s certified mail requirement.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Immediate and Ongoing Harm</strong>: DBG Properties’ actions have led to reputation damage, security risks, and potential ADA violations, all impacting your business’s stability and operations.</ul></li>

The TRO can provide immediate relief by temporarily preventing DBG Properties from enforcing the lease termination. This will allow you to seek a more permanent solution through the injunction process. Let me know if you need further assistance preparing for the TRO filing or if there are additional details to consider.</div>
                        </div>
                    
                        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4 shadow-sm">
                            <div class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">User</div>
                            <div class="message-text">Is it worth note that once i responded to their lease termination notice sent on October 1st, citing the fact that they had not communicated via the terms of the lease, they re-sent a letter via certified mail? This essentially acknowledges that they should have been doing so the entire time?</div>
                        </div>
                    
                        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4 shadow-sm">
                            <div class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Assistant</div>
                            <div class="message-text">Yes, that’s a crucial detail to emphasize. The fact that DBG Properties re-sent the <strong>October 1st lease termination notice via certified mail</strong> after you highlighted their failure to comply with the lease’s notice requirements effectively serves as an acknowledgment that they had not been following the lease’s prescribed method of communication up to that point. This act reinforces your argument that:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>DBG Properties was aware of the procedural requirement</strong> for certified or registered mail, as specified in the lease.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Their previous notices were improperly delivered</strong>, thus undermining the legitimacy of those notices and any actions based on them.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>This re-sending is an implicit admission</strong> that they should have adhered to the notice terms from the beginning.</ol></li>

In your TRO filing, you can use this as further evidence of procedural violations. This action by DBG Properties suggests that they were attempting to “correct” their previous mistakes only after you brought them to their attention, casting doubt on the validity of all earlier notices, including the initial “Notice to Pay or Quit” and the premature default notice.

<h3>Suggested Language for the TRO Application</h3>
In your TRO application, you could state something like:

> "After I responded to DBG Properties’ October 1st lease termination notice, citing their failure to follow the notice delivery requirements as outlined in our lease, DBG Properties re-sent the termination notice via certified mail. This action implicitly acknowledges that DBG Properties was aware of the lease’s specific notice delivery requirements and had been disregarding them. The re-sent notice constitutes an admission that prior communications—including the initial 'Notice to Pay or Quit'—were procedurally improper and invalid."

This point strengthens your case by showing that DBG Properties only began following the lease terms for notice delivery after being called out on it, thus invalidating the initial notices and any subsequent actions stemming from them.</div>

                            <div class="message-text">After reviewing the lease and your previous communications, here are some critical points for preparing a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) in Cabell County, WV, and the supporting documents:

<h3>Key Points from Lease and Communications:</h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Delivery of Notices</strong>: The lease requires notices to be sent by certified mail, registered mail, or a recognized courier. Initially, DBG did not comply, delivering notices by hand, which you contested. Their subsequent certified mail re-delivery could imply acknowledgment that they should follow the lease terms for notice delivery.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Event of Default Terms</strong>: According to Section 24 of the lease, you should be given a written notice and 10 business days to cure any default. DBG’s notice timing and delivery were inconsistent with this, as they issued a Notice of Default before allowing the full cure period.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Trade Fixture Rights</strong>: Section 11(e) of the lease provides that you can remove trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment that you own, provided it doesn’t cause costly damage and you make necessary repairs. Their attempt to prevent this might be inconsistent with the lease terms.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>ADA Violation</strong>: DBG’s failure to repair the handicap-accessible entry potentially constitutes an ADA violation, which strengthens your case for maintaining occupancy to meet accessibility standards.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Evidence of Attempted Payments</strong>: Your attempts to pay rent on September 30th and October 4th should be documented. This supports the argument that DBG is acting in bad faith by obstructing payment, violating implied good faith.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: DBG’s refusal to change the back door code despite multiple requests heightens security risks, given turnover rates and access by former employees. This is a potential argument for their negligence.</ol></li>

<h3>Steps to Prepare for Filing a TRO:</h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Compile Supporting Documents</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Lease Agreement</strong>: Highlight sections regarding notice delivery, default cure period, and trade fixture rights.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Certified Mail Receipts</strong>: Show any certified correspondence proving attempts at compliance with lease terms.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Previous Communications</strong>: Include text messages and emails showing attempts to cure defaults, payment efforts, and any obstructive behavior by DBG.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Photos or ADA Documentation</strong>: If possible, document the faulty handicap-accessible entry.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Evidence of Security Requests</strong>: Any records showing requests for backdoor code changes and DBG’s response or lack thereof.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Draft the TRO Petition</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Introduction</strong>: Briefly introduce your identity, the business address, and the purpose of the TRO.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Grounds for TRO</strong>:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Improper Notices</strong>: Explain how DBG’s notices were improperly delivered and acknowledge their re-sent certified mail, showing their awareness of the proper procedure.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Violation of Cure Period</strong>: Highlight DBG’s failure to allow the full 10-day cure period for rent defaults as stipulated.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>ADA Non-Compliance</strong>: Note the inaccessibility of the handicap entryway due to DBG’s lack of repairs, which affects your compliance with ADA standards.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Security Negligence</strong>: Emphasize DBG’s failure to update the back door code, raising safety concerns.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Request for TRO</strong>: State that you request an injunction preventing DBG from enforcing the eviction or lease termination until a full hearing can determine DBG’s compliance with the lease terms.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>File the TRO</strong>:</ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>Visit the Circuit Court of Cabell County</strong>: Go to the clerk’s office to file. Take multiple copies of your petition and supporting documents.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Filing Fees</strong>: Be prepared to pay any filing fees. Ask the clerk if you qualify for any fee waivers.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Prepare for a Hearing</strong>: The judge may schedule a hearing promptly. Be ready to present evidence, including your compiled documents, lease agreement, and communications with DBG.</ul></li>

<h3>Detailed Instructions for Court:</h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Locate the Clerk's Office</strong>: Visit the Cabell County Courthouse and go to the circuit court clerk's office to file your TRO.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Submit Documentation</strong>: Provide the clerk with the TRO petition and supporting documents. Request certified copies for your records.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Ask About Next Steps</strong>: Confirm with the clerk about any further paperwork, filing fees, or additional documentation they may require.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Attend the Hearing</strong>: If scheduled, present your case. Clearly explain how DBG’s actions have been non-compliant with lease terms, their disregard for ADA compliance, and their negligence in maintaining a secure premise.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Follow-Up</strong>: After filing, stay in touch with the court for updates on the TRO status and be prepared for any additional documentation requests.</ol></li>

These steps will establish a strong foundation for filing a TRO in your local court, supporting your claim with robust documentation and a clear understanding of the lease terms DBG has potentially violated.

                            <div class="message-text">To file a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) in Cabell County, West Virginia, it's essential to understand the specific requirements and procedures. Here's a comprehensive guide to assist you:

<strong>1. Understanding a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO):</strong>

A TRO is a court order intended to provide immediate protection by temporarily prohibiting a party from engaging in certain actions until a formal hearing can be held. In the context of your lease dispute, a TRO would aim to prevent DBG Properties from enforcing eviction or lease termination until the court resolves the matter.

<strong>2. Grounds for Filing a TRO in West Virginia:</strong>

In West Virginia, to obtain a TRO, you must demonstrate:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Immediate and Irreparable Harm:</strong> Evidence that without the TRO, you would suffer harm that cannot be remedied by monetary damages alone.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Likelihood of Success on the Merits:</strong> A reasonable probability that you will prevail in the underlying dispute.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Balance of Equities:</strong> The harm you would suffer without the TRO outweighs any potential harm to the opposing party if the TRO is granted.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Public Interest:</strong> Issuing the TRO aligns with public policy considerations.</ul></li>

<strong>3. Preparing the TRO Application:</strong>

Your application should include:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Verified Complaint:</strong> A detailed account of the facts, supported by evidence, demonstrating the need for a TRO.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Affidavit:</strong> A sworn statement attesting to the truthfulness of the facts presented.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Proposed Order:</strong> A draft of the TRO for the judge's consideration.</ul></li>

<strong>4. Filing the TRO in Cabell County:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Venue:</strong> File your application with the Circuit Court of Cabell County, as it has jurisdiction over such matters.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Filing Fees:</strong> Inquire with the clerk's office about any applicable fees. Fee waivers may be available if you meet certain criteria.</ul></li>

<strong>5. Serving the TRO:</strong>

Once the court issues the TRO, ensure that DBG Properties is promptly served with the order, following West Virginia's rules for service of process.

<strong>6. Scheduling a Hearing:</strong>

The court will set a date for a preliminary injunction hearing, typically within a short timeframe, to determine whether to extend the TRO until a final decision is made.

<strong>7. Legal Representation:</strong>

While it's possible to file a TRO pro se (without an attorney), consulting with a lawyer experienced in West Virginia property law is advisable to navigate the complexities of the process effectively.

<strong>8. Additional Resources:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>West Virginia Judiciary:</strong> Provides court forms and procedural information. citeturn0search2</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Legal Aid of West Virginia:</strong> Offers assistance and resources for individuals seeking legal help.</ul></li>

<strong>9. Important Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Documentation:</strong> Gather all relevant documents, including the lease agreement, correspondence with DBG Properties, and any evidence supporting your claims.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Timeliness:</strong> Act promptly, as delays can affect the court's perception of the urgency of your request.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Compliance:</strong> Ensure that all filings and procedures comply with West Virginia's legal standards to avoid procedural dismissals.</ul></li>

<h3>1. <strong>Verified Complaint for TRO</strong></h3>

This document introduces the facts of your case and the legal grounds for the TRO. Here’s a structure to follow, with examples of language for each part:

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>[Verified Complaint Heading]</strong>

Circuit Court of Cabell County, West Virginia  
Plaintiff: [Your Name/Business Entity]  
Defendant: DBG Properties, LLC  
Case No.: [To be filled by the court clerk]

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>[Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order]</strong>

<strong>Introduction</strong>  
I, [Your Name], the [Title, e.g., President of NAVI Inc.], am filing this Verified Complaint seeking an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent DBG Properties, LLC from enforcing an eviction and lease termination at [Property Address].

<strong>Facts of the Case</strong>  
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Parties and Lease Agreement</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff operates a licensed business, [Le Bistro/The Cellar Door], located at [Full Address], Huntington, WV, under a lease with DBG Properties, LLC.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties delivered a "Notice of Event of Default" and "Notice to Pay or Quit," claiming repeated rent default and other alleged lease violations.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Improper Delivery of Notices</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under Section 36 of the lease, all official notices must be sent via certified or registered mail. DBG Properties failed to comply, delivering the notices by hand instead. This action invalidates these notices.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Premature Default Notice</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The lease mandates a 10-business-day cure period for any rent default. The notice provided on [Date of Pay or Quit Notice] did not allow the full cure period before issuing the Notice of Default, making the notice procedurally improper.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Plaintiff's Good-Faith Payment Attempts</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff attempted to pay both September and October rent on multiple dates (September 30, October 4, and October 7), but DBG Properties refused payment on all occasions. These attempts demonstrate Plaintiff’s intent to fulfill financial obligations.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Further Procedural and Security Concerns</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff raised issues regarding ADA compliance and security, including requests to fix the handicap-accessible entrance and update security codes. DBG Properties has not addressed these matters, impacting business operations and safety.</ul>

<strong>Legal Grounds for TRO</strong>  
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Immediate and Irreparable Harm</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The termination of Plaintiff’s lease will cause irreparable harm, including loss of business, damage to Plaintiff's reputation, and financial impact that cannot be compensated by monetary damages alone.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Likelihood of Success on the Merits</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff has complied with lease obligations and made good-faith efforts to resolve the alleged defaults, demonstrating a high probability of prevailing in this dispute.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Balance of Equities</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The harm to Plaintiff from eviction and business disruption outweighs any potential harm DBG Properties may experience from maintaining the status quo until a full hearing.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Public Interest</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Ensuring businesses operate in compliance with ADA standards and are protected from unlawful eviction is in the public interest.</ul>

<strong>Request for Relief</strong>  
Plaintiff respectfully requests the court to:
<ul>   - Issue a Temporary Restraining Order against DBG Properties, preventing any eviction or lease termination actions until a full hearing can determine the matter.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Grant further relief as deemed just and proper by the court.</ul></li>

<h3><strong>Drafted Verified Complaint for TRO</strong></h3>

<strong>Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order</strong>

<strong>Introduction</strong>  
I, Christopher Craven, President of Navi Inc., which owns subsidiary Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., DBA Le Bistro & The Cellar Door, am filing this Verified Complaint seeking an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent DBG Properties, LLC from enforcing an eviction and lease termination at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV.

<strong>Facts of the Case</strong>

<ul>   - Plaintiff operates a licensed business, Le Bistro & The Cellar Door, located at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, under a lease with DBG Properties, LLC.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties delivered a "Notice of Event of Default" and "Notice to Pay or Quit," claiming repeated rent default and other alleged lease violations.</ul></li>

<ul>   - The lease mandates a 10-business-day cure period for any rent default. The notice provided on September 25, 2024, did not allow the full cure period before issuing the Notice of Default, making the notice procedurally improper.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Plaintiff's Good-Faith Payment Attempts</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff attempted to pay both September and October rent on multiple dates (September 30, October 4, and October 7), but DBG Properties refused payment on all occasions. These attempts demonstrate Plaintiff’s intent to fulfill financial obligations.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Further Procedural and Security Concerns</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff raised issues regarding ADA compliance and security, including requests to fix the handicap-accessible entrance and update security codes. DBG Properties has not addressed these matters, impacting business operations and safety.</ul>

<strong>Legal Grounds for TRO</strong>  
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Immediate and Irreparable Harm</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The termination of Plaintiff’s lease will cause irreparable harm, including loss of business, damage to Plaintiff's reputation, and financial impact that cannot be compensated by monetary damages alone.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Likelihood of Success on the Merits</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff has complied with lease obligations and made good-faith efforts to resolve the alleged defaults, demonstrating a high probability of prevailing in this dispute.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Balance of Equities</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The harm to Plaintiff from eviction and business disruption outweighs any potential harm DBG Properties may experience from maintaining the status quo until a full hearing.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Public Interest</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Ensuring businesses operate in compliance with ADA standards and are protected from unlawful eviction is in the public interest.</ul>

<strong>Request for Relief</strong>  
Plaintiff respectfully requests the court to:
<ul>   - Issue a Temporary Restraining Order against DBG Properties, preventing any eviction or lease termination actions until a full hearing can determine the matter.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Grant further relief as deemed just and proper by the court.</ul></li>

<h3>1. <strong>Notarization Requirements</strong></h3>

The only document that requires notarization is the <strong>Affidavit</strong> in Support of the TRO. Here’s what you’ll do:
<ul>   - <strong>Affidavit</strong>: Sign in the presence of a notary, who will then stamp and sign it to verify the document. This is crucial because it attests to the accuracy of the facts you’re presenting under oath.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Notarization Availability</strong>: Many courthouses, banks, or UPS locations offer notary services. Make sure to bring a photo ID for the notarization process.</ul></li>

<h3>2. <strong>Supporting Evidence Documentation</strong></h3>

It’s recommended to print all relevant supporting documents, as these provide the judge with context and proof of your claims. Key items to include:
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Lease Agreement</strong>: Print a copy of the lease, highlighting relevant sections:</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24 (Default and Cure Period)</strong>: Demonstrates the requirement for a 10-business-day cure period.</li>

<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Payment Attempts</strong>: Any evidence of payment attempts made on September 30, October 4, and October 7, including communication with DBG Properties (emails, text messages, or written receipts) to show good-faith efforts to cure the default.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Delivery of Notices by DBG Properties</strong>: Copies of the "Notice to Pay or Quit" and "Notice of Default," showing improper hand delivery (if you have documentation or photos) and any later certified mail re-delivery.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Your Response Letters</strong>: Include your October 2 response letter and the subsequent communication to DBG Properties, which detail your objections to their improper notice procedures and refusal of payments.</li>

                            <div class="message-text">Are you sure this response is thorough? Given the high risk associated with a less than thorough response, i would have assumed you wouldnt miss a section of the lease that needs highlighted… especially as they note it in their last written communication.

                            <div class="message-text">Thank you for prompting me to double-check. You’re absolutely correct—there is an additional critical section in the lease that should be highlighted: <strong>Section 7(b)</strong>, which addresses the permitted use of the premises. DBG Properties has cited this in their communications, particularly their claim that your business operates as a bar, which you’ve refuted by demonstrating that food sales constitute over 70% of revenue.

This section is essential because:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Section 7(b) (Permitted Use)</strong> directly supports your argument that you’re operating within lease terms as a restaurant, not exclusively as a bar.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Documentation of Food Sales</strong>: Your financial records showing food sales as the majority of your revenue reinforce compliance with Section 7(b).</ol></li>

<h3>Updated Key Sections for Highlighting in the Lease:</h3>
<ul>- <strong>Section 7(b)</strong>: Defines permitted use, supporting your compliance by showing you operate primarily as a restaurant.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 24</strong>: Specifies default procedures, including the cure period for any rent default.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 36</strong>: Outlines the delivery requirements for official notices, requiring certified or registered mail.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Section 11(e)</strong>: Establishes your rights to trade fixtures, supporting your position on fixture removal if lease termination proceeds.</ul></li>

With this inclusion, I’ll update the steps to emphasize this section in your supporting evidence. This added clarity strengthens your case by directly refuting DBG Properties’ claim of a lease violation based on operational use. 

Thank you again for ensuring a thorough review—I’ll incorporate Section 7(b) into the final checklist to fully address DBG’s assertions in your filing. Let me know if you’d like further support with any of these elements.</div>

<h3><strong>[Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order]</strong></h3>

<strong>[Header]</strong>  
Circuit Court of Cabell County, West Virginia  
Plaintiff: Christopher Craven, President of NAVI Inc. & Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc.  
Defendant: DBG Properties, LLC  
Case No.: [To be assigned by the court]

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>[Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order]</strong>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<strong>Introduction</strong>  
I, Christopher Craven, President of NAVI Inc. & Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., DBA Le Bistro & The Cellar Door, am filing this Verified Complaint seeking an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent DBG Properties, LLC from enforcing an eviction or lease termination at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV. Without this TRO, DBG Properties intends to proceed with eviction, causing immediate and irreparable harm to my business operations and reputation.

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Facts of the Case</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Lease Agreement and Compliance</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff operates <em>Le Bistro</em> and <em>The Cellar Door</em>, both located at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, under a lease with DBG Properties, LLC. NAVI Inc. owns Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., which operates both establishments.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Under <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, the premises are designated for use as a restaurant. My establishments comply with this, with over 70% of revenue coming from food sales, thus qualifying as a restaurant under the lease and state law (WV Code §60-7-2).</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Improper Delivery of Notices</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Section <strong>36 (Notices)</strong> of the lease requires DBG Properties to deliver official notices by certified or registered mail. However:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The “Notice to Pay or Quit” was hand-delivered on September 25, 2024, by the building manager, Matt Stickler.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The “Notice of Event of Default” was delivered by his office assistant on October 1, 2024.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Both notices were improperly delivered in violation of the lease, making them procedurally invalid and unenforceable.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Premature Default Notice</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under <strong>Section 24 (Defaults)</strong>, the lease requires a 10-business-day cure period for rent defaults. The “Notice to Pay or Quit” issued on September 25 did not allow for the full cure period before the “Notice of Event of Default” was issued on October 1, only 4 business days later. This premature notice further invalidates DBG Properties' claim of default.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Good-Faith Payment Attempts by Plaintiff</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - I attempted in good faith to cure any rent default by delivering payment on multiple occasions:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September 30, 2024</strong> – Payment was attempted before the cure period ended.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 4, 2024</strong> – A second payment attempt was made, but DBG Properties was unavailable after 3:30 PM.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 7, 2024</strong> – I attempted to pay September and October rent in cash, but DBG Properties refused payment.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties' refusal to accept payment obstructed my ability to cure the alleged default, demonstrating bad faith on their part.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Additional Lease Violations and Neglect by DBG Properties</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>ADA Non-Compliance</strong>: DBG Properties has failed to ensure proper functioning of the handicap-accessible double doors, restricting wheelchair access to <em>The Cellar Door</em> for at least 50% of open hours. This negligence may constitute a violation of ADA requirements, impacting my business’s ability to serve patrons with disabilities.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: Repeated requests to DBG Properties to update the back door code for security reasons due to high turnover were ignored, posing ongoing security risks to the premises.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Tenant’s Rights to Trade Fixtures</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under <strong>Section 11(e)</strong>, I retain the right to remove trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment that I own, provided removal does not cause excessive damage. Despite DBG Properties' implications to the contrary, I intend to exercise my rights to these trade fixtures if necessary.</ul>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Legal Grounds for Temporary Restraining Order</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Immediate and Irreparable Harm</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Without a TRO, DBG Properties is likely to proceed with eviction tomorrow, November 9, 2024, potentially changing the locks. This will cause immediate irreparable harm, including:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Loss of business and interruption to daily operations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Significant reputational damage within the Huntington community.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Financial losses not compensable by monetary damages alone.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Likelihood of Success on the Merits</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The lease requires DBG Properties to follow proper delivery procedures and to allow a cure period, which they violated. My consistent efforts to comply with lease terms and to make payments establish a high probability of success in the underlying dispute.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Balance of Equities</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The harm I would suffer from eviction greatly outweighs any inconvenience DBG Properties may experience from maintaining the status quo until a full hearing is held. The TRO will ensure fairness while protecting my business’s continuity.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Public Interest</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Issuing a TRO aligns with public interest by upholding ADA standards and preventing wrongful eviction. My business serves the local community and contributes positively to Huntington’s economy and culture.</ul>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3><strong>Request for Relief</strong></h3>

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Issue a Temporary Restraining Order</strong> against DBG Properties, LLC, preventing them from taking any action to terminate the lease or evict Plaintiff from 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, until a hearing can be held to address these matters.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Schedule a Hearing</strong> at the earliest possible date to consider a preliminary injunction to maintain this order.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Grant further relief</strong> as deemed just and proper by the Court.</ol></li>

However, if you’d like to make the document look cleaner for submission:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Remove the Brackets</strong>: Delete the brackets themselves (leaving the placeholder text). For example, instead of <code>[To be assigned by the court clerk]</code>, you would write “To be assigned by the court clerk” in plain text.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Notate These as Pending</strong>: If you want to make it clear to the court that these details will be provided upon filing, you could italicize them or write “(To be assigned by the court clerk)” without brackets to make it visually smoother.</ol></li>

Either approach works well, but you don’t need to manually fill in anything within the brackets unless the court clerk provides that information on the spot. This way, your submission is clear, professional, and prepared for completion during the filing process.</div>

<h3><strong>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF CABELL COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA</strong></h3>

<strong>Christopher Craven,</strong>  
<strong>President of NAVI Inc. & Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., DBA Le Bistro & The Cellar Door</strong>  
<em>Plaintiff,</em>  

v.  

<strong>DBG Properties, LLC,</strong>  
<em>Defendant.</em>  

<strong>Case No.:</strong> To be assigned by the court clerk

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h2><strong>Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order</strong></h2>

<strong>Introduction</strong>  
I, Christopher Craven, President of NAVI Inc. & Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., DBA Le Bistro & The Cellar Door, am filing this Verified Complaint seeking an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent DBG Properties, LLC from enforcing an eviction or lease termination at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV. Without this TRO, DBG Properties intends to proceed with eviction, causing immediate and irreparable harm to my business operations and reputation.

<h3><strong>Facts of the Case</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Lease Agreement and Compliance</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff operates <em>Le Bistro</em> and <em>The Cellar Door</em>, both located at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, under a lease with DBG Properties, LLC. NAVI Inc. owns Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., which operates both establishments.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Under <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, the premises are designated for use as a restaurant. My establishments comply with this, with over 70% of revenue coming from food sales, thus qualifying as a restaurant under the lease and state law (WV Code §60-7-2).</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Improper Delivery of Notices</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Section <strong>36 (Notices)</strong> of the lease requires DBG Properties to deliver official notices by certified or registered mail. However:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The “Notice to Pay or Quit” was hand-delivered on September 25, 2024, by the building manager, Matt Stickler.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The “Notice of Event of Default” was delivered by his office assistant on October 1, 2024.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Both notices were improperly delivered in violation of the lease, making them procedurally invalid and unenforceable.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Premature Default Notice</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under <strong>Section 24 (Defaults)</strong>, the lease requires a 10-business-day cure period for rent defaults. The “Notice to Pay or Quit” issued on September 25 did not allow for the full cure period before the “Notice of Event of Default” was issued on October 1, only 4 business days later. This premature notice further invalidates DBG Properties' claim of default.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Good-Faith Payment Attempts by Plaintiff</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - I attempted in good faith to cure any rent default by delivering payment on multiple occasions:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September 30, 2024</strong> – Payment was attempted before the cure period ended.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 4, 2024</strong> – A second payment attempt was made, but DBG Properties was unavailable after 3:30 PM.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 7, 2024</strong> – I attempted to pay September and October rent in cash, but DBG Properties refused payment.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties' refusal to accept payment obstructed my ability to cure the alleged default, demonstrating bad faith on their part.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Additional Lease Violations and Neglect by DBG Properties</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>ADA Non-Compliance</strong>: DBG Properties has failed to ensure proper functioning of the handicap-accessible double doors, restricting wheelchair access to <em>The Cellar Door</em> for at least 50% of open hours. This negligence may constitute a violation of ADA requirements, impacting my business’s ability to serve patrons with disabilities.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: Repeated requests to DBG Properties to update the back door code for security reasons due to high turnover were ignored, posing ongoing security risks to the premises.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Tenant’s Rights to Trade Fixtures</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under <strong>Section 11(e)</strong>, I retain the right to remove trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment that I own, provided removal does not cause excessive damage. Despite DBG Properties' implications to the contrary, I intend to exercise my rights to these trade fixtures if necessary.</ul>

<h3><strong>Legal Grounds for Temporary Restraining Order</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Immediate and Irreparable Harm</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Without a TRO, DBG Properties is likely to proceed with eviction tomorrow, November 9, 2024, potentially changing the locks. This will cause immediate irreparable harm, including:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Loss of business and interruption to daily operations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Significant reputational damage within the Huntington community.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Financial losses not compensable by monetary damages alone.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Likelihood of Success on the Merits</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The lease requires DBG Properties to follow proper delivery procedures and to allow a cure period, which they violated. My consistent efforts to comply with lease terms and to make payments establish a high probability of success in the underlying dispute.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Balance of Equities</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The harm I would suffer from eviction greatly outweighs any inconvenience DBG Properties may experience from maintaining the status quo until a full hearing is held. The TRO will ensure fairness while protecting my business’s continuity.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Public Interest</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Issuing a TRO aligns with public interest by upholding ADA standards and preventing wrongful eviction. My business serves the local community and contributes positively to Huntington’s economy and culture.</ul>

<h3><strong>Request for Relief</strong></h3>

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Issue a Temporary Restraining Order</strong> against DBG Properties, LLC, preventing them from taking any action to terminate the lease or evict Plaintiff from 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, until a hearing can be held to address these matters.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Schedule a Hearing</strong> at the earliest possible date to consider a preliminary injunction to maintain this order.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Grant further relief</strong> as deemed just and proper by the Court.</ol></li>

<ul>   - Plaintiff operates <em>Le Bistro</em> and <em>The Cellar Door</em>, both located at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, under a lease with DBG Properties, LLC. NAVI Inc. owns Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., which operates both establishments.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Under <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, the premises are designated for use as a restaurant. My establishments comply with this, with over 70% of revenue coming from food sales, thus qualifying as a restaurant under the lease and state law (WV Code §60-7-2).</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Improper Delivery of Notices</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Section <strong>36 (Notices)</strong> of the lease requires DBG Properties to deliver official notices by certified or registered mail. However:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The “Notice to Pay or Quit” was hand-delivered on September 25, 2024, by the building manager, Matt Stickler.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The “Notice of Event of Default” was delivered by his office assistant on October 1, 2024.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Both notices were improperly delivered in violation of the lease, making them procedurally invalid and unenforceable.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Premature Default Notice</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under <strong>Section 24 (Defaults)</strong>, the lease requires a 10-business-day cure period for rent defaults. The “Notice to Pay or Quit” issued on September 25 did not allow for the full cure period before the “Notice of Event of Default” was issued on October 1, only 4 business days later. This premature notice further invalidates DBG Properties' claim of default.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Good-Faith Payment Attempts by Plaintiff</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - I attempted in good faith to cure any rent default by delivering payment on multiple occasions:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September 30, 2024</strong> – Payment was attempted before the cure period ended.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 4, 2024</strong> – A second payment attempt was made, but DBG Properties was unavailable after 3:30 PM.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 7, 2024</strong> – I attempted to pay September and October rent in cash, but DBG Properties refused payment.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties' refusal to accept payment obstructed my ability to cure the alleged default, demonstrating bad faith on their part.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Additional Lease Violations and Neglect by DBG Properties</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>ADA Non-Compliance</strong>: DBG Properties has failed to ensure proper functioning of the handicap-accessible double doors, restricting wheelchair access to <em>The Cellar Door</em> for at least 50% of open hours. This negligence may constitute a violation of ADA requirements, impacting my business’s ability to serve patrons with disabilities.
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: Repeated requests to DBG Properties to update the back door code for security reasons due to high turnover were ignored, posing ongoing security risks to the premises.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Tenant’s Rights to Trade Fixtures</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under <strong>Section 11(e)</strong>, I retain the right to remove trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment that I own, provided removal does not cause excessive damage. Despite DBG Properties' implications to the contrary, I intend to exercise my rights to these trade fixtures if necessary.</ul>

<h3><strong>Legal Grounds for Temporary Restraining Order</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Immediate and Irreparable Harm</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Without a TRO, DBG Properties is likely to proceed with eviction tomorrow, November 9, 2024, potentially changing the locks. This will cause immediate irreparable harm, including:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Loss of business and interruption to daily operations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Significant reputational damage within the Huntington community.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Financial losses not compensable by monetary damages alone.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Likelihood of Success on the Merits</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The lease requires DBG Properties to follow proper delivery procedures and to allow a cure period, which they violated. My consistent efforts to comply with lease terms and to make payments establish a high probability of success in the underlying dispute.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Balance of Equities</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The harm I would suffer from eviction greatly outweighs any inconvenience DBG Properties may experience from maintaining the status quo until a full hearing is held. The TRO will ensure fairness while protecting my business’s continuity.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Public Interest</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Issuing a TRO aligns with public interest by upholding ADA standards and preventing wrongful eviction. My business serves the local community and contributes positively to Huntington’s economy and culture.</ul>

<h3><strong>Request for Relief</strong></h3>

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Issue a Temporary Restraining Order</strong> against DBG Properties, LLC, preventing them from taking any action to terminate the lease or evict Plaintiff from 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, until a hearing can be held to address these matters.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Schedule a Hearing</strong> at the earliest possible date to consider a preliminary injunction to maintain this order.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Grant further relief</strong> as deemed just and proper by the Court.</ol></li>

<h3><strong>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF CABELL COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA</strong></h3>

<strong>Christopher Craven,</strong>  
<strong>President of NAVI Inc. & Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., DBA Le Bistro & The Cellar Door</strong>  
<em>Plaintiff,</em>  

v.  

<strong>DBG Properties, LLC,</strong>  
<em>Defendant.</em>  

<strong>Case No.:</strong> To be assigned by the court clerk

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h2><strong>Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order</strong></h2>

<strong>Introduction</strong>  
I, Christopher Craven, President of NAVI Inc. & Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., DBA Le Bistro & The Cellar Door, am filing this Verified Complaint seeking an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent DBG Properties, LLC from enforcing an eviction or lease termination at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV. Without this TRO, DBG Properties intends to proceed with eviction, causing immediate and irreparable harm to my business operations and reputation.

<h3><strong>Facts of the Case</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Lease Agreement and Compliance</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Plaintiff operates <em>Le Bistro</em> and <em>The Cellar Door</em>, both located at 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, under a lease with DBG Properties, LLC. NAVI Inc. owns Abraham Restaurant Industries, Inc., which operates both establishments.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Under <strong>Section 7(b)</strong> of the lease, the premises are designated for use as a restaurant. My establishments comply with this requirement, with over 70% of revenue coming from food sales, as shown in Exhibit A (Monthly Sales Breakdown for Food and Alcohol Revenue). This qualifies the establishments as a restaurant under the lease and state law (WV Code §60-7-2).</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Improper Delivery of Notices</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Section <strong>36 (Notices)</strong> of the lease requires DBG Properties to deliver official notices by certified or registered mail. However:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The “Notice to Pay or Quit” was hand-delivered on September 25, 2024, by the building manager, Matt Stickler (Exhibit B – Notice to Pay or Quit and Corresponding Delivery Details).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">The “Notice of Event of Default” was delivered by his office assistant on October 1, 2024 (Exhibit C – Notice of Event of Default and Corresponding Delivery Details).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Both notices were improperly delivered in violation of the lease, making them procedurally invalid and unenforceable.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Premature Default Notice</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under <strong>Section 24 (Defaults)</strong>, the lease requires a 10-business-day cure period for rent defaults. The “Notice to Pay or Quit” issued on September 25 did not allow for the full cure period before the “Notice of Event of Default” was issued on October 1, only 4 business days later. This premature notice further invalidates DBG Properties' claim of default (Exhibit D – Lease Agreement with Relevant Sections Highlighted).</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Good-Faith Payment Attempts by Plaintiff</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - I attempted in good faith to cure any rent default by delivering payment on multiple occasions:
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>September 30, 2024</strong> – Payment was attempted before the cure period ended (Exhibit E – Proof of Payment Attempt on September 30).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 4, 2024</strong> – A second payment attempt was made, but DBG Properties was unavailable after 3:30 PM (Exhibit F – Proof of Payment Attempt on October 4).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>October 7, 2024</strong> – I attempted to pay September and October rent in cash, but DBG Properties refused payment (Exhibit G – Proof of Payment Attempt on October 7).</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">DBG Properties' refusal to accept payment obstructed my ability to cure the alleged default, demonstrating bad faith on their part.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Additional Lease Violations and Neglect by DBG Properties</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - <strong>ADA Non-Compliance</strong>: DBG Properties has failed to ensure proper functioning of the handicap-accessible double doors, restricting wheelchair access to <em>The Cellar Door</em> for at least 50% of open hours. This negligence may constitute a violation of ADA requirements, impacting my business’s ability to serve patrons with disabilities (Exhibit H – Photographs of Inoperable Handicap-Accessible Doors).
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: Repeated requests to DBG Properties to update the back door code for security reasons due to high turnover were ignored, posing ongoing security risks to the premises (Exhibit I – Requests for Back Door Code Update).</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Tenant’s Rights to Trade Fixtures</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Under <strong>Section 11(e)</strong>, I retain the right to remove trade fixtures, merchandise, and equipment that I own, provided removal does not cause excessive damage. Despite DBG Properties' implications to the contrary, I intend to exercise my rights to these trade fixtures if necessary (Exhibit D – Lease Agreement with Relevant Sections Highlighted).</ul>

<h3><strong>Legal Grounds for Temporary Restraining Order</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Immediate and Irreparable Harm</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Without a TRO, DBG Properties is likely to proceed with eviction tomorrow, November 9, 2024, potentially changing the locks. This will cause immediate irreparable harm, including:
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Loss of business and interruption to daily operations.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Significant reputational damage within the Huntington community.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Financial losses not compensable by monetary damages alone.</ul></li>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Likelihood of Success on the Merits</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The lease requires DBG Properties to follow proper delivery procedures and to allow a cure period, which they violated. My consistent efforts to comply with lease terms and to make payments establish a high probability of success in the underlying dispute.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Balance of Equities</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - The harm I would suffer from eviction greatly outweighs any inconvenience DBG Properties may experience from maintaining the status quo until a full hearing is held. The TRO will ensure fairness while protecting my business’s continuity.</ul>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Public Interest</strong>  </ol></li>
<ul>   - Issuing a TRO aligns with public interest by upholding ADA standards and preventing wrongful eviction. My business serves the local community and contributes positively to Huntington’s economy and culture.</ul>

<h3><strong>Request for Relief</strong></h3>

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Issue a Temporary Restraining Order</strong> against DBG Properties, LLC, preventing them from taking any action to terminate the lease or evict Plaintiff from 905 3rd Avenue, Huntington, WV, until a hearing can be held to address these matters.</li>

                            <div class="message-text">For a professional and court-ready presentation, each exhibit should be labeled clearly, following these steps:

<h3>1. <strong>Cover Page for Each Exhibit</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Create a Separate Cover Page</strong>: Insert a blank sheet in front of each exhibit with a clear, centered label, such as:</ul></li>
     <pre class="message-code">
     Exhibit A
     Monthly Sales Breakdown for Food and Alcohol Revenue
     </pre>
<ul>     - Use bold text for “Exhibit A” (or the corresponding letter) and list the exhibit title below in regular font.
<li class="list-disc ml-6">Repeat this for each exhibit, changing the letter and title as appropriate.</ul></li>

<h3>2. <strong>Label in the Top-Right Corner (Alternative)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">If cover pages aren’t feasible, you can instead label each exhibit in the <strong>top-right corner of the first page of the document</strong> itself. Write or type:</ul></li>
     <pre class="message-code">
     Exhibit A
     </pre>
<ul>     - This method is acceptable and keeps the label visible without a cover page, but cover pages are generally preferred for clarity.</ul>

<h3>3. <strong>Exhibit List in the Main Document</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">In your Verified Complaint, you’ve listed each exhibit in the order referenced. This serves as a table of contents, which the court can follow to quickly locate each exhibit.</ul></li>

<h3>4. <strong>Paper Tabs or Stickers (Optional)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6">For added clarity, especially if the court prefers physical tabs, you can use <strong>sticky tabs or exhibit stickers</strong> (often available as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit B,” etc., in legal supply stores or online). Place these tabs on the side or bottom of each exhibit cover page so the court can easily flip to each one.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3>Summary of Steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Preferred Method</strong>: Cover page for each exhibit with the label in bold.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Alternative</strong>: Label the first page of each document in the top-right corner.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Optional Enhancement</strong>: Use sticky tabs or stickers if available.</ul></li>

This labeling approach will ensure that each exhibit is easy to identify and reference, making a professional impression for the court.</div>

                            <div class="message-text">If I were advising DBG Properties in this situation, here are the likely counterarguments and strategies they might use in response to your TRO request:

<h3>1. <strong>Challenge the Definition of “Restaurant” vs. “Bar” Use (Section 7(b))</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Argument</strong>: DBG Properties might argue that <em>The Cellar Door</em> operates as a bar and not primarily as a restaurant, claiming that the majority of revenue comes from alcohol sales or that the venue’s activities resemble those of a bar more than a traditional restaurant.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Strategy</strong>: They could request access to sales records to scrutinize the food-to-alcohol sales ratio or point to promotional materials (such as social media posts) or operational practices that they argue align more closely with a bar.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Ensure you have clear evidence (monthly sales breakdowns, promotional material emphasizing food service) that demonstrates the establishment meets the 70% food sales threshold.</ul></li>

<h3>2. <strong>Highlight Past Late Payments and Attempt to Enforce Lease Termination Under Repeated Default Clause</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Argument</strong>: DBG Properties could argue that repeated late payments justify lease termination under the "repeated default" clause in Section 24, asserting that past leniency does not negate the right to enforce this clause now.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Strategy</strong>: They may present a history of your payment patterns to establish a pattern of late payments, attempting to frame these instances as violations that accumulate over time and support their termination attempt.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Emphasize that their continued acceptance of late payments without written notice constitutes a waiver of the right to enforce this clause. Additionally, highlight the absence of certified notices for any prior late payments, which procedural failures weaken their argument.</ul></li>

<h3>3. <strong>Claim Procedural Errors as “Harmless Errors” Regarding Notice Delivery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Argument</strong>: DBG Properties might argue that their delivery of notices by hand was a "harmless error" that did not invalidate the notices, especially if you were clearly informed of the default and had the opportunity to cure it.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Strategy</strong>: They might cite instances where you responded to or acknowledged these notices, attempting to show that the method of delivery did not materially impact your awareness or ability to comply.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Reiterate that the lease specifically requires certified or registered mail for formal notices and that DBG Properties’ subsequent re-sending of notices by certified mail is an implicit acknowledgment that hand delivery was insufficient.</ul></li>

<h3>4. <strong>Contend Payment Refusals Were Justified Due to Termination Intent</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Argument</strong>: DBG Properties may argue that once they decided to terminate the lease, they had no obligation to accept payments after the cure period ended, viewing further payments as moot.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Strategy</strong>: They could assert that their refusal to accept payments was a legitimate action after the cure period, aiming to prove they were consistent with the termination intent.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Emphasize that they refused payment even within the cure period, thus undermining this argument. Also, argue that the premature default notice and their refusal to accept rent show an intent to force termination rather than a genuine enforcement of lease terms.</ul></li>

<h3>5. <strong>Question the ADA and Security Complaints as Justification for TRO</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Argument</strong>: DBG Properties might argue that the ADA and security concerns raised in your filing are unrelated to the core issue of default and lease termination, thus irrelevant to the TRO request.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Strategy</strong>: They might present these issues as secondary concerns that do not directly impact the legitimacy of the lease termination or your right to occupy the premises.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Position these issues as part of a pattern of negligence, showing that DBG’s failure to address these concerns compromised your business’s safe operation and accessibility, further underscoring their bad faith behavior.</ul></li>

<h3>6. <strong>Argue that the TRO Will Cause Undue Financial Harm to DBG Properties</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Argument</strong>: DBG Properties might contend that the TRO will cause them significant financial harm by preventing them from renting the space to another tenant.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Strategy</strong>: They could try to demonstrate that granting the TRO limits their income potential, especially if they had another potential tenant lined up. They might even argue reputational harm if you publicly contest their position.</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-6"><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Argue that the harm to your business—loss of reputation, customers, and goodwill—outweighs any short-term financial loss they might experience. Additionally, emphasize your willingness to continue paying rent, thus minimizing their financial risk during the TRO period.</ul></li>

<hr class="my-4 border-gray-300">
<h3>Summary of Your Best Rebuttals</h3>
<ol>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Establish Your Primary Status as a Restaurant</strong>: Use financial records to confirm that food sales are the majority, highlighting specific promotions or events focused on dining.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Highlight Waiver Due to Procedural Failures</strong>: Emphasize DBG’s lack of written notice for past late payments and their procedural mistakes in notice delivery, framing these errors as intentional waivers of rights.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Document Good-Faith Payment Efforts</strong>: Provide clear documentation showing your intent to cure defaults, underscoring DBG’s refusal to accept payments within the cure period as evidence of bad faith.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Position ADA and Security Issues as Signs of Negligence</strong>: Argue that DBG’s failure to address these concerns shows neglect, which undermines their ability to argue in good faith for lease enforcement.</li>
<li class="list-decimal ml-6"><strong>Focus on Equitable Harm to Your Business</strong>: Clearly articulate the greater harm to your business reputation and continuity if the TRO is denied, positioning this as a more significant impact than their potential short-term financial harm.</ol></li>

By anticipating these potential counterarguments, you can prepare to rebut them thoroughly, reinforcing your position with documented evidence and a clear emphasis on good-faith compliance with the lease terms.</div>
